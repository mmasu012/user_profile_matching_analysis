So we thought we'd do some for free till we have good enough portfolio to attract paid projects. So if you have any good projects, shoot in the comment section or send me a PM!

Experience: I worked as a Data Science intern during my senior year summer where I did analytics, EDA and AB Testing for a product start-up. Also built and deployed a recommender and content rating models on production. My friend is top 50 in Kernels and top 100 in Discussion in Kaggle. Will send you verifications personally.

Basically we want something that makes it easy to schedule and deploy our models (Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks). We don't have the technical resources to be building Dockerfiles from scratch, and we really want something idiot-proof since some of these will be mission critical and central to our company's work. Something with integrated version control (based on Git) would be nice. We are not interested in drag-and-drop GUI machine learning pipelines, we're comfortable with our Python/Jupyter Notebook workflow. It has to work behind a firewall. It should have robust user management with permissions etc. We just need something to take our models to production in a smooth, organized way.

We've looked mostly at Anaconda Enterprise, but it's hard to find user experiences with it. There isn't a free trial but it looks otherwise like a good fit for us.

How is this done for a physical product? For example, a newspaper or magazine company; do distribution outlets maintain Excel sheets on where newspaper sales happen which the parent company have access to? Do people manually do data entry at these places? Or does a local shopping market make an entry of where their customers are from so that they can make a KMeans cluster and focus on that particular area?  


If anyone has any experience regarding this, I would love to know it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/cozfa4/how_is_data_collectiondata_science_done_at_a/,6,2019/08/11-10:16:10
33,datascience,bg5nb1,roonishpower,Going wrong in scoring social media posts of a user based on the post history and influence,True,"So I'm a student who got an outsourced data science gig doing self-directed learning on this data-set, just imagine a data-set similar to Instagram. Where we have USER table with the userID, account creation date, number of followers, number of following, description, handle, gender, and other important profile info and table POSTS with the posts on social media with the no of likes, no of comments, reach, date, date posted, trending etc. Then I also have csv full of comments which I'm not using for the analysis now.

Now I want to create a model that will score these posts based on the popularity and performance. So my first and my very naive approach was to split the POSTS into the train and test randomly. Then on the train, I would group by the userId and create aggregate features ['sum', 'max', 'min', 'mean', 'var'] on the different numeric columns. Then I would add merge this data to the USER with its own numeric columns, I would call this table HISTORY, which would give us the past performance of the post. Then the really stupid thing I did (I think?) was to add the HISTORY data back to the train POSTS (yes, the same one which I used to aggregate features of) and test POSTS.

The scoring metric I used to score the post was sigmoid(log(like+1) + log(reach + 1) + log(no of comments + 1) + log(trending + 1)) which yielded a score between 0 and 1. But there was an excess amount of posts with score 0. So while training I had to undersample the zero scores. And I used the Post Time + History to predict this particular score.

So I'm doing self-directed learning this data-set and it's kind of an outsourced work to me and I feel like I'm stuck making progress in the wrong direction. I think I went wrong on the following places

• Creating a proper metric for scoring the posts, a better way to score posts?
• Using the train data to generate aggregate history than using the same train data to append this history onto. 
• Splitting the train and test data randomly. Because in this case, if a post on the train is a user's first post, I would add the HISTORY to this post but that doesn't make any sense in reality.
• The data is spread over 2 years, is some inconsistency going to creep up?
• Most of the scoring lies in this [distribution](https://imgur.com/JaXQBpJ), I would like it to be spread out. 
• To judge the performance of the model, I was using Precision. The number of high-quality posts, which was actually scored high. Is this a proper metric to use? Can we actually use the confusion matrix here by setting a threshold on the score to differentiate between posts that scored high and low?
• How to prepare train and test data? Should I use 70% Posts to aggregate features, then use 25% for training and 5% for testing?
 
I feel like I've approached this problem wrong from the first step itself and I did a lot of thinking to myself but I'm incapable of figuring out what's wrong. Any insights, tips and resources would literally save my life.

We literally keep all our files in flat files on various servers and don't have access to any relational databases whatsoever and our CEO straight up came out and said he didn't believe in outsourcing our data storage to the cloud. Now the tech team is very excited that they're introducing this cutting edge dremio service. On some quick googles it appears to be more geared towards cloud data lakes, but if it allows me to query our non-cloud relational data with the low latency the sales pitch provides I'll be happy. Right now our options are to either read the entire dataset into memory and process using python or R, or else we can set up an ETL process to move the data from a flat file into hdfs, but where the latency tends to mean any individual query will take 30 seconds at a minimum. Our data is relatively large but not really ""big data"", the main dataset we use is around 50gb.

I got my 1st job after graduating with 2 internships under my belt. I felt I was ready to take on the world.

I started to work for a start up, I moved countries, I was really excited about it but apparently I couldn't present results fast enough or accurate enough.

I always like to assume responsibility, as it is the only way to growth.

On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables, PMs told me to work with those tables, but those were the wrong tables. I eventually found that I had to request special access to my department's tables... and for some reason those tables were hidden from general view...

2nd and 3rd months I was working with SQL+JSON tables plus all the side tasks. Apparently I did not manage to fully understand the concept of SQL + JSON very well. My numbers were always wrong.

The pandemic hasn't been kind to me (and many others, I know) my focus hasn't been what is used to be, I feel slower, less energetic and less smart.. And the other day I was sent by back to my country, yesterday I broke up with a girl I was seeing... Everything sucks at the moment.

I am not really sure what to do. I like SQL, I like helping business making sense of data, I like doing ad-hocs projects in R or Python. Or at least I thought I did...

I am starting to doubt myself, I feel I am not good enough and that Data might not be for me...

61,datascience,ofuslv,veeeerain,Do I just need to develop thick skin? Or is the group being unreasonable? (Rant),True,"Hello all, I’m working as an undergrad analyst for my teams baseball team this summer, and I’m working with 3-4 other undergrads as well, and led by two professors in the economics dept. We help the baseball coaches by mining their pitch by pitch data and bringing them any ideas we have or visualizations. It’s been a really cool experience so far, we are building a shiny dashboard for them to help visualize their player pitching tendencies, collecting data from other sources, it’s fun…. However, I’m not having a fun time as a member.

As the only person on this team with no domain knowledge of baseball (literally have never played it nor have I ever watched it) any idea I bring gets shut down by other team members. The whole concept of this is that whatever idea I may have which may seem like a “breakthrough” or a “paradigm shift” In thinking, is just met with “u/veeerain this is not useful in baseball, let us tell you”. It’s gotten to the point where I work on my own projects because I feel they are useful from reading outside sources and then tell only one econ professor about it because he thinks it’s neat. 

Last meeting was the final straw for me, I was talking about my progress and how I was running into a road block with my project and while the professors were giving me tips on where to go next or pivot, I had another member on the team argue against my idea and basically imply I should drop it, even when he had literally know idea what it’s useful for. He even side messaged me in group me and gave me a passive aggressive message saying how he wants to educate me on what is useful in baseball.

It’s just gets my blood boiling because rather than us working together, it’s just a competition of who can impress or wow the coaches the most. And people attacking my ideas rather than giving me new ways to go. Im no baseball guru but I’m a stats major and I know how to work and interpret data! They don’t give me any trust as a numbers guy that what I’m trying had any value. 

This has been a rant, but do you think something like this is common in the workplace? And do I need to develop thick skin? Or are my team members being unreasonable and is this a whole different issue. This may not be the place for such workplace drama but oh well.

Hello all, I’m currently an undergraduate stats major who will be a junior in the fall. My goals is to apply to PhD programs in senior fall. If I wanted to look at opportunities for the summer prior to it, should I look into doing research within say the stats dept? Or should I be trying to look for an actual internship at a company? My research interests are within statistical learning, so I was thinking a research role would be better suited for me than some data analytics position at a company.

I feel that it will be hard for me to get on any papers or do research because I won’t have a ton of theory knowledge, but I’m hoping I can get on something more applied.

So what do you think? I feel like trying to get a research role would be better when applying then doing SQL all day at a company for a summer, chances are even if I expressed my case as I want to do some more data science and quantitative sort of internship it wouldn’t be as good as if I did research with a prof.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nv589x/research_or_internship_in_prep_for_phd/,7,2021/06/08-07:25:09

Current role with a few other students had been to look at their pitch sequencing data and to find insights. I had an idea today that I was presenting to them, and I made sure not to overwhelm them with technicals, provided insight into methodology, (didn’t state a value proposition, which is where I probably messed up), but as I’m going, midway through my 30-45 sec breakdown the professor cuts me off and starts talking about another students idea. Doesn’t even let me finish. I was pretty disappointed because I was pretty confident in my idea, but he didn’t want to continue listening.

My question is, does this happen a lot in industry when presenting to management? Do they sometimes dismiss your ideas like this? 

Also maybe give me some advice on how to pitch something too, I am planning on scheduling a meeting with those two professors again to give them a full run through of my idea and why it’s useful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nwbzk3/professor_cuts_me_off_mid_presentation_and/,16,2021/06/09-18:43:44

But sometimes I don't get to do the most interesting work so I think about getting into part-time freelancing. I had one person in my network pitch me an app idea for his small business. I had a conversation with their ceo, he seemed super interested, pitched me some requirements, answered some questions. I then roughed out the specific work required, how much time it would take, and used $50/hour as my baseline pay needed even though that's below what my regular job pays. Normally I'd need more for working beyond my full-time job because it would require sacrificing my social life, but the project was extremely interesting and could have led to a good relationship and more work down the road. But when he saw my estimate that it'd take 200 hours to complete aka $10k he said my estimates all made sense but thanks but no thanks. The fact that he didn't even attempt to counter makes me think he was expecting to pay like $1k for it, even though the guy who pitched the idea to me said that for $10k they'd recoup costs in a few months because they paid contractors to manually do the work my app would have automated, plus they lose money on mistakes the contractors regularly make.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what's the market like for work like this? Are people actually able to build custom data-driven apps where they're paid 5 figures for completed projects?

I’ve noticed there’s an interesting niche within the field of Bayesian statistics that goes into probabilistic programming, building Bayesian models, Bayesian deep learning etc. This area seems like a big topic in research as well. My question is more so geared towards industry, but what is the trend recently when it comes to using Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming in a company? My intuition tells me that  Bayesian methods are really interpretable to stats/DS/math folks, but to those outside of that in industry, say stakeholders or upper level management it may not be as interpretable. With most baseline statistics classes starting off at the frequentist perspective, it seems that these are the methods which are really interpretable to management in industry, and thus there is not much of a use case for probabilistic programming and Bayesian methods other than research.

Can anyone speak to this? I’m curious to see how much of an acceptance there is to probabilistic programming  in the industry and if it is really only limited to research?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nridri/how_much_has_probabilistic_programming_been/,19,2021/06/03-10:04:18

The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

I’ve heard a lot that in tech the work can be mundane, and purely SQL work or analyst related work and nothing really quantitative unless you have a PhD. 

This was one of the main motivators for me to work towards a phd but I realized this may be  flawed. I get that more product facing companies won’t really need data scientists to do stats but more just help with data engineering related tasks and query databases.

However, I want to ask, for you “data scientists” (NOT QUANTS) in the financial sector, how is the work like in (hedge funds, banks, insurance) with an MS stats degree? Is it the same boring SQL stuff or do you actually get to do something quantitative and not feel like you wasted your time and money getting a MS? Or is it the same trend where phds only get to do cool stuff. I’ve been applying for internships in asset management type roles where they do portfolio analysis and such but idk if this counts as data science or not. Also, emphasis on if it’s something quantitative, doesn’t have to be doing ML, because so I’ve heard that jobs where you build ML models isnt even a real thing anymore. As long as I’m doing something statistical with an MS degree and applying something to my jobs that’s all that matters.

So my question is, what metrics do you all talk about or focus on when doing classification/regression. Or just machine learning models in general. It may seem like a naive question I’m curious.

87,datascience,l873zt,BullCityPicker,Son of 'I hate people who type asdf asdf into comment fields' -- I built a better solution,True,"A week ago, I typed in a post fuming about people who'd type stuff into optional text fields that wasted my time.  Some of this text was actual phrases like ""No comment"", and others were just random keyboard smashes like ""asdf asdf"".  I got LOTS of responses, roughly grouped into:

1) ""Easy -- just write a regex for it!""   This isn't a complete solution, as people just keep coming up with new tweaks, like ""asdf asDf asdF"" instead, or ""No comment at this time"".

2) ""Easy -- just do dictionary lookups!""  This isn't a complete solution either, as any special domain -- medicine is the one I'm working in -- has lots of words that don't appear in dictionaries, like drug names, obscure acronyms, and abbreviations.

3) ""Suck it up, it's called work for a reason. ""  Excuse me, Polyanna, griping about work is kind of a thing on the internet.

I put some thought into your responses, and thought I could do better.  Here's what my solution looks like:

1) Parse the complete set of data, drop it to lower case, and strip the punctuation and white space, and create a dictionary of unique words.   For each word, decide if it's in the regular dictionary, a dictionary of domain terms I keep as a csv, and count the frequency of occurrence. 

2) For each comment, 

   a) Clean it up,

  b) If it matches any of the known ""throwaway"" phrases, like ""No comment at this time"", score it as 100%

c) Else, go through the words, and count it as a 'good word' if it's in the dictionary, the special vocabulary file, or....it occurs a lot.   I've counted it fully as a 'good word' if it's in the corpus 10 times, as 0.75 of a good word if it's in there 5 times, etc.    This works great if the project is in a domain I haven't done before.

You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete.

Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon.

Hello all, I wanted to know what the differences are between a masters in statistics and masters in machine learning, and which one you guys think has more meaning to an employer or has a better ROI. They both seem to have some overlaps, but the MS in ML seemed to have more modern coursework as opposed to statistics heavy course load. There was definitely stats classes, but I saw more modern classes like deep learning/reinforcement learning etc. 

For those of you who did a MS in stat or a MS in ML share some thoughts on what you thought about the programs and if you think there’s a real difference between the two? Does a MS in ML convey to a company that your more of a software engineer cut out to be a machine learning engineer? Does a MS in stat make you more of a “data scientist” role where you have the quantitative knowledge? In your guys opinion which degree provides more impact and shows what you can be employable for vs a “flashy name”.  Which of the two is more “curriculum dependent”?

112,datascience,ovtud0,BullCityPicker,Advice on Project -- Masking Personally Identifiable Information in a large number of files,True,"&amp;#x200B;

I  have a consulting practice where I evaluate educational programs.  In those programs, participants are identified in fairly regular ways with personally identifiable information (PII) (first and last name, email, address, title, and certain industry standard numerical identifiers).  For most of the time of my practice, the data has been kept internally safe and encrypted.  

My major client asked to share a filespace in the last year, and we're using DropBox Pro to do that.   He's become concerned that DropBox could be hacked and personally identifiable information (PII) could get disclosed.   My first choice in how deal with this would be to go through the files (mostly CSV, some Excel) and look for fields I know have PII in them.  This is pretty doable in theory, as I've controlled the naming standards.  The problem is that it's a LOT of files, probably several hundred.    I'd then like to modify the PII in some way to obfuscate it, without destroying the usefulness of it.  (Some simple solution like UUENCODING the data would be strong enough for me, I don't think strong crypto is necessary.)  It would be desirable for the data to be encoded in a unique way (so if ""Joe Smith"" in one file hashes to a particular key, it should do that in another file so I join the data).

I can write code to do this (R is what I usually use for these projects) in a variety of language, although it's in Windows, so my ability to use scripting languages is limited.

Specifically, does anyone know R modules for uuencoding data with a key, or know of any packages or tools that would be useful in this project?  I suppose a variant would be to strongly encrypt data directories of everything over a year old, which I don't use much, and just do things the ""right"" way going forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ovtud0/advice_on_project_masking_personally_identifiable/,12,2021/08/01-08:11:20

123,datascience,mylh4e,veeeerain,Is there diversity in Machine Learning Engineer backgrounds like there is with DS?,True,"I’m a statistics student in school, and my goal is to become a “data scientist”, in quotations because that can mean many different things. Anyways, I’ve heard that data scientists tend to have very diverse backgrounds depending on the industry, ie. Statistics/computer science/Math/civil engineering (or some other engineering) / physics ie. List goes on and on.
Even saw someone who was a geospatial data scientist with a background in something GIS related. 
Point is it seems like the “data scientist” has very diverse backgrounds for the role.

However, for something like “machine learning engineer”, is this as diverse? I mean yea there is some machine learning involved, so some statistics, but 90% I’ve heard is SWE related, so most of the backgrounds are generally computer science? Am I right in saying that? For people who are non computer science, is there a higher barrier to entry to become a MLE than it is to be a data scientist?

Last recruiting season I started too late (november) and didn’t get any internships. I also felt my projects were not where they could have been. This summer I wanted to revamp my projects and add new ones as well as start the application process a bit earlier. 

With regards to projects, I was wondering if hiring managers preferred to see a “theme” of projects as opposed to a jack of all trades type. Meaning, I’m really into text analytics &amp; sports analytics, so I was going to surround my projects solely around these two topics. 

1. Because I feel like showing you can work with data your interested in helps you talk about it easier in interviews

2. You have more motivation to finish the project because it’s a topic of interest.


I feel like having a bunch of projects with no grouping or theme of any sort may come across as weird because it’s all a bunch of seemingly non related skills which I haven’t really mastered or been proficient at yet. 

For any hiring managers out there what do you think? Do you like to see applicants projects have some sort of natural grouping to them?

I switched majors because I wanted to learn more of the math, and I just genuinely liked statistics and wasn’t all into the systems design courses later on in the major.

Long story short, my naive young self a few months ago kept thinking that as a stats major I could get away with working with machine learning algorithms and big data with a masters degree in statistics, and that I would never face data structures and algorithms again.

137,datascience,m74n1a,BullCityPicker,Text Analytics &amp; LDA Topic Creation -- Any success stories?,True,"I've been doing some text analytics work, and am trying out LDA (Latent Direchlet Analysis) as a way of categorizing text into different topics.  I've used it for two sets of survey data, one from local post offices, and one from medical education, and some police report data. Before getting into real data, I ran through some online exercises in R and Python, for sorting chapters of classic books.  (You know, where you get ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", and ""Nemo"", ""Submarine"", and so forth pop out, and ""Pride and Prejudice"", where ""Elizabeth"", and ""Proposal"" pop out, and so on.)

I'm unwhelmed by the results.   For the data sets I'd done topic modeling on by hand, and have a fair amount of domain knowledge.   I've played with varying parameters, but had a fairly clear idea going in what a 'reasonable' number of categories would be.

The category clusters use common words, but I can't think what the clusters are supposed to represent, even when I go back and look at the quotes that best match those categories.   For example, with the post office one, you'd think ""Damaged stuff"", ""Late Mail"",  ""Missing Items"", or ""Like my Mail Guy"" would come out, but I can't go from the word clusters suggested by LDA to any of these obvious categories.  In the medical stuff, one concept that gets mentioned a lot is ""Broken Arm Syndrome"", and I find that ""Broken"" and ""Arm"" appear in different clusters.  (There's nothing else in this data set related to ""Broken"" or ""Arm"" separately).

I'm wondering if text size is the problem.  While the corpus size is at least 10k's of words, and \~1M in some sets, the individual quotes are almost all &lt;100 words, with some only a few.  Could that be the problem?   Those of you who have some experiences with real data sets and LDA, could you confirm or deny whether you've been successful.  I'm best in R, but I've done some work in Python and SAS Viya also, and done LDA in all of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m74n1a/text_analytics_lda_topic_creation_any_success/,0,2021/03/17-09:43:46

It was towards the end where I had asked him how optimization techniques could be used in predictive modeling and machine learning. He told me that the concepts he was telling us about actually didn’t fall under predictive analytics, but prescriptive analytics. The difference being predictive analytics is using previous data to predict new outcomes, and prescriptive analytics being using previous data to find what the most optimal solution is. That peaked my interest because thus far I have had a rather narrow view on data science with only predictive analytics and machine learning as my focus of interest, however I wanted to learn more about the prescriptive analytics side.

For those of you who work with prescriptive analytics, what are some math topics or sub topics that could help me explore this?

I’ve only really done “statistical” programming in python and R, mainly done data analysis/cleaning and sklearn/tidymodels model fitting in a notebook or rmarkdown. And some basic dashboarding in streamlit. My plan is to get a MS in applied statistics and then work in Data Science. My major kind of aligns along the classical statistician type of background, which I’m okay with because I wanted a strong math background for a career in DS cause that’s what I THOUGHT was important. But I’ve come to realize that it’s a lot less important than software dev/cs skills. 

, I said to myself that I wasn’t going to complain about this because I thought that I would just try and learn data structures/algs and relevant cs topics to at least have some sort of software skills.

Everywhere I’ve read about jobs in DS it’s that you need 75% software skills related to productionising and maybe 25% of statistical knowledge. These aren’t hard facts but basically from what I’ve read stats and math knowledge is not as useful as cs/software dev skills.

I’m just worried I’m going to go through all this schooling only to compete with software developers, and then learn all these various software tools only to become a software dev with a rigorous stats background and a “Data scientist” title when I’m not even doing any sort of statistical work, and my stats background will be a waste of money/time.

I want to be close to Machine Learning/statistical learning and building models, but it just seems like these software skills related to data eng/production tools are going to overshadow any statistical knowledge I have gained through my degree, thus making my degree a waste since I will be using maybe 5% of it.

I’m rambling here, but could any data scientists in industry here with an applied stats/stats background shed light on if their degree is really used in data science industry. And really how much statistical knowledge u actually get to apply relative to software dev knowledge? And if u felt like the degree was a waste compared to if you got a CS degree? 

It just seems like industry doesn’t actually care if you have stat/ML knowledge but more so if you can use software skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lcl23v/worried_that_my_degree_will_be_useless/,42,2021/02/04-09:34:36

150,datascience,ljygoh,veeeerain,Udacity nanodegrees or certifications even worth it?,True,"Hello all, I’m currently a sophomore in college. I’ve been working with data science tools for over a year now, mainly python and R and their related ML/data cleaning packages (tidyverse/pandas/sklearn/tf/numpy etc) in various projects of mine and undergrad research.

Long story short, I’ve been applying for internships for the past 8 months and haven’t even gotten an email back from half of them, let alone an interview. I have a feeling that this may because I’m too young and I’m just competing with juniors or seniors for these roles. So I just get auto rejected. 

Anyways, considering the fact that most companies may not be looking for interns anymore, I have accepted the fact that maybe I just need to expand my skill set a bit more, so I’ve decided to tackle another side of data science this summer in self learning data engineering. Specifically I was thinking about doing a udacity nanodegree program or doing certifications to help boost my resume. I was looking at the data engineering nanodegree to be exact.

I thought that this, combined with any projects I do in the summer may make me a better candidate come fall when I’m a junior.

Now my question to any of you hiring managers/recruiters or anyone out there. Is purchasing a certification course or doing these long MOOC courses a good idea? Is it worth the money? Obviously it won’t guarantee me an internship but would it stand out to you in anyway if a student had this? Would I be better off saving my money and just looking through online resources instead of paying for a nanodegree program or a certification program? 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this in general to see what you guys think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ljygoh/udacity_nanodegrees_or_certifications_even_worth/,0,2021/02/14-14:00:20

157,datascience,nlh1wv,BullCityPicker,"Ideal Text Analytics Data Structure -- One Document at a time, or one Row at a Time?",True,"I just got tossed an interesting problem by management.   There's a lot of a certain type of document laying out agreements between labor/mgmt at the local branches, and a poor understanding at the top over what topics occur regularly in these documents.  It's over a thousand .txt documents, up to about 15k characters in each, so there's a lot to look through, and therefore, text analytics to the rescue.

I just got finished reading them all into Hadoop and turning them into a big table of the form:

Row = LineOfText,OriginalDocumentName

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get too far into the modeling part, I'm wondering if this is the best form to have the data in, or whether I'd do better with a format of:

Row = EntireDocument, OriginalDocumentName

&amp;#x200B;

My tools will be SAS Viya's text analytics primarily because I like the concept modeling part, and some R package like tidytext and whatever I can find for concept formation (R is my real go-to language, but I'm a bit of a noob in text analytics, and don't fully understand those packages yet.)  I've done some with Python's nltk and similar packages, although I'm expert level in R, and struggle some in Python.

Any thoughts about what's the best general format to use -- one line at a time, or the entire document at a time?   By the way, the documents come from a variety of sources like Word, PDF, and OCR input, and are pretty low quality in terms of misread or mangled words, white space, and weird control characters.  I'm not sure there's an obvious way to skip the line feeds in a Hive import to get to the second document-as-a-row format, but I can cross that bridge later, and have a few databases whizzes on my team that could help me figure it out if needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nlh1wv/ideal_text_analytics_data_structure_one_document/,19,2021/05/26-06:28:53

Supervised, unsupervised learning, data cleaning, relevant software &amp; packages to do these tasks with datasets, working with unstructured data such as text.

But looking back after one year I realized I only scratched the surface, I took a cs course on data structures and algorithms where we had graph theory and we had to write graph proofs and I swept it under the rug because I didn’t think it was applicable to data science

I had this notion that all data science was is statistics and probability being used in large datasets with the use of fast computers, but I disregarded  graph theory.

I’m doing undergrad research now and being challenged  by my professor to go farther than just statistical learning methods, which is kind of my bread and butter, and look into network analysis.

Doing a quick Google search I’ve realized network analysis is widely applicable and graph theory is needed heavily when modeling relationships. 

As a statistics student, should I be focusing on graph theory fundamentals too? My major only offers math courses in linear algebra, real analysis, and multi variable calculus, but no graph theory.

Am I wrong?,True,"I’m currently a sophomore statistics student in college, with a solid passion for data science, and I know it’s something I want to get into. I love machine learning, and statistics and the past few months, since quarantine started up until now, I had been going in on python, and learning to implement packages in my own projects and overall getting a grip on data science workflow. However, over the summer as a freshman going into the sophomore year, I wanted to get some kind of internship to put on my resume, so I was offered to work as a web dev by a student who had her own non profit (SHES a junior) and I was working with the CTO on the website here and there, while asynchronously working in my own stuff. In short I learned one thing, I kinda don’t like web development. React was cool, but I’m a very math based person and data science is just more of a problem i care about solving. 

Anyways, fast forward to now and the founder of the non profit is paying someone to do the website, and SHES kind of hinting at me to do it over my winter break. But the thing is I have already set up my own plans for self learning and internship search:

Learn R

Learn more math for ML, and DL, 

Finish the 
deeplearning.AI specialization course

Go through the intro to statistical learning book in chunks, and try and get more of a foundation of the sklearn algos 

Work on the kaggle project I’m submitting to the NFL data bowl competition.

Basically just data science related stuff. And now I have been offered this task and I really don’t want to take it, because A, it’s been months since I’ve done web dev stuff, and I’ve only ever been doing data science related stuff since the summer, and to be Frank I really don’t want to spend my summer learning the MERN stack because data science internships I sign up for won’t really take heed to that vs me doing my own projects in data science and building data skills. Is this the right mindset? Can any data science recruiters/manger here give me some feedback here?

My mindset of “data science tools and projects and self learning matter more than MERN website means more” all in all I just won’t have time to accomplish what I want is I take up this project.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jue8de/im_trading_web_dev_project_more_self_learning_am/,4,2020/11/14-18:19:38
175,datascience,jno1fv,veeeerain,Runtime analysis in data science interviews,True,"Hello, currently an undergrad here whose majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science. So far I’ve taken general software courses in java, covering basic data structures (queue, stacks, maps,) and algorithms applying those (linkedlists, binary search, hashing) etc. however along with those I’m in a “foundations of discrete structures” course, which is less coding and more so stuff about algorithmic analysis and runtime analysis. Recurrence relations and writing expressions of for and while loops to understand the runtime of them and do big O and omega analysis. Anyways, I’ve found out I am very bad at this stuff, and well legitimately failed a midterm with it. So my question is, how much runtime analysis is asked in data science interviews?

188,datascience,etr3c4,roonishpower,Advice needed to create an economic News dataset for niche categories that will be used for classification.,True,"So basically we're trying to create a dataset for classifying news articles into different classes like cybercrime, corruption, acquisition, merger, all of which would be economic news. We're using BERT to train our classifier and needed 2k-3k articles per class for an MVP.

So right now, we were gathering articles by using APIs like webhose.io and pushshift.io to fetch a batch of articles based on a keyword ""cybercrime"" and hand label it to make sure it actually is cybercrime and remove false positives and duplicates. It's kind of tiring since we need to go through 20k articles to get 2k for each class. 

We were looking for services and anything which would make this process easier. We're students, so we'd prefer some free service, but we're willing to spend money if we get very desperate. Any advice is welcome!

I am a statistics Major in college, and I throughly enjoy the application of statistical knowledge to solving business cases, modeling probability distributions, hypothesis testing, simulations, and doing machine learning modeling. I find it very rewarding to do EDA and preprocessing and pro typing models, because it makes me feel close to the business case. And through personal projects I have done it’s great knowing that I come away from a dataset which I may have known nothing about, and learned something knew from solving a problem I was interested in. 

However, while I do enjoy this I also really enjoy deep learning research, and the applications and implementation of deep learning models for things like NLP, Computer Vision etc. For once I like enjoy reading research papers, and learning about new deep learning architectures and applications. 

However, I have read there’s no real happy medium with these two professions. I have heard that companies tend to not need these fancy deep learning models, so deep learning more so is left for research positions, however the statistical modeling and data science work is more so prevalent in companies as it is what they need to solve business decisions. This leaves me with having to pick whether I want to do research, or work in a company, and both I enjoy but just can’t figure out what. I’m really not trying to salary is a deciding factor here, but what is more important or what do you think in your opinion is in demand/will have the most positions available?

Hello,

I’m new to web scraping and I am planning on starting my first project soon. However I’m getting bogged down by all the different frameworks or packages that can be used. Could someone explain the main ones to me like (Scrapy, Selenium, Requests) and tell me what the differences are, and if so what other ones that I could use that would be suitable for a beginner? I know how to use chrome developer tools, but there’s a lot out there so if someone could give me some advice and direction on what I should use, that would be great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/igouvn/beginner_webscraping_advice/,4,2020/08/25-17:43:23

216,datascience,kgo2kz,veeeerain,Simplistic Datasets for teaching,True,"Hey all! I’m currently a sophomore in college, and I am the education director for the big data analytics student organization at my university. I am planning the workshops for this semesters boot camp to introduce club members to data science in python and R. I want to be able to teach effectively and get the concepts across clearly to beginners getting bogged down by complexities in datasets. I wanted to ask you all if you know of very simple datasets that would be good introductions for beginners that are well known that I could be missing. 

I plan on using some classic ones:

Iris dataset
Titanic dataset
California housing prices 
Wine quality 

What are some other datasets which are well known for beginners? These could even be the kinds of datasets that hiring managers see on resumes that they aren’t impressed by since they are too simplistic. This is perfect for beginners.

The data science workflow to beginners is foreign enough, choosing easy datasets will help them learn more efficiently!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kgo2kz/simplistic_datasets_for_teaching/,7,2020/12/19-21:04:52
217,datascience,knidbc,veeeerain,How often do you just keep it simple?,True,"Hello all, I’m a sophomore undergraduate statistics Major who has dabbled in a lot of various parts of data science in the past 8 months. DL/ML/classical statistical modeling/time series forecasting, id say a good breadth of the field. Datacamp was my quarantine friend lol. 

Don’t get me wrong, I think DL is phenomenal, the applications to research, the various tools like tensorflow, pytorch, all very cool stuff. But you know, sometimes I wonder if it’s kind of overkill? Like sure for computer vision/music data I get it, deep learning is important. But does industry ever just kinda keep it simple and use classical ML instead of DL in production? It just seems to me that sometimes not everything has to be thrown into a tensorflow model and deployed when even a linear model would be just as powerful.

I’ll give you an example of why my mind triggered this thought. When I was learning time series forecasting, I was learning how to use basic arima models/linear models to forecast non stationary time series. Obviously I had to do preprocessing and all that dirty work before hand but I would end up using a simple arima model which for the most cases if my preprocessing was good, did pretty well. It wasn’t until I started learning Deep Learning until I found out you could do time series forecasting with RNNs.... I couldn’t help but thinking: 

why? This just seems so complicated for no reason, why does deep learning have to solve this problem? Why would someone bother using an RNN when you could just use a linear model?

It was in that moment that I felt, maybe DL make things harder than they should be.

But more than just knowing how to use python, R, SQL ive spent double the amount of time knowing the basics of statistics, and advanced topics. I’m  not a computer science major or data science major... I’m a statistics Major applying for data science positions. Descriptive  stats, probability, inference tests, hypothesis tests, regression, proofs, statistical learning theory, Bayesian stats are all things I’ve spent time understanding and implementing myself in various ways and making sure I understand. I’m no expert, but I’d say I’ve spent more time focusing on those fundamentals before fitting some model which I don’t know works behind the scenes. And yes I did end up using python R and these tools to implement it, but point is, I’ve focused a lot on my statistics knowledge maybe 60% of it vs 40% on the desired tools like python R and SQL because I thought it was what is desired for data science positions. My question is for any people out there who interview do you even care that I know how to carry out statistical methods? Or more so if I can write efficient queries? Am I focusing on the wrong stuff? Am I just a pure statistician and not a data science intern? Starting to think statistics knowledge isnt valued as much as how well ik how to use the software tools in a technical interview.

As a freshman I started out as a data analytics major, but then switched during this fall because I wanted to have more of a math foundation. The data analytics major at my university is very selective and only takes about 20-30 kids a year. Anyways i was outlining my statistics Major and I was going to take a statistical learning elective for my stats major. Then my advisor told me that the statistical learning course starting this fall has been “only made exclusive to data analytics majors”. As in I can’t even take it as a stats major. It’s not even a required course in the data analytics major it’s an elective just like it is for me. My question is does that really make sense? I mean I’m sure you can’t decipher why they would do it because you guys didn’t make that decision with them, but u think it even makes sense to make it exclusive like that? Only to data analytics majors? The class is a stats elective at least extend it to statistics majors? Like it’s not even a machine learning class or AI class, it’s a statistical learning class, so it’s foundations of the machine learning algorithms.

1st problem coordinate 'compiler':

I am practically a newbie in python, and I was tasked to create a word search program in python. As of now I can find the coordinates of a certain character given a board, but it finds ALL instances of the characters and there is no way to know whether that letter belongs to that certain word. A I would really appreciate some help!

2nd problem:

I tried to progress on the code to not waste time. But I have no idea how to go on. After, supposedly getting the coordinates the code must also state the word's direction (e.g right,left,down-left,up-left,down-right,up-right). I have no idea on I would get this. I was thinking about using slope to determine the direction but I have been running around circles on how exactly I would be translating this into a python code. Thank you so much in advance for your help!

I have already tried restricting to having only one character taken per row, but I realize this won't do since multiple words can be in the same row. Really hit a dead end here.

So basically this is the section that gets the coordinates of the first letter of the given 'words' in the board.

    words=['row', 'war', 'raw','rar','dew','rod','red']
    rows= ['rar', 'aoe', 'wed',]#rows in the board 
    for row_number, row in enumerate(rows):     
         for column_number, letter in enumerate(row):        
              for word in words:            
                  if word[0]==letter: 
                    print(letter,(column_number+1,row_number+1)) 

1st problem:

The code gives me an output of:

    r (1, 1) 
    r (1, 1) 
    r (1, 1) 
    r (1, 1) 
    r (1, 1) 
    r (3, 1)
     r (3, 1) 
    r (3, 1) 
    r (3, 1) 
    r (3, 1) 
    w (1, 3) 
    d (3, 3) 

As could see the coordinates are really not that helpful. It seems that it just keep finding the same letter again and again How would I fix this?

2nd problem:

I was hoping to produce the output:

    word(x,y)-direction 

The (x,y) coordinate is somehow almost done and I think I can store the solutions the only problem left now is how I would determine the direction. Thanks again for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/d7pctr/coding_a_word_search_program_in_python/,4,2019/09/22-04:46:44

Hi Guys! I am creating a word search code for python and I hit a dead end. I was able to find the starting letters of the words in the given board. But I can't make it go to the right direction it just literally finds every letter, I know I am still missing a few blocks but I can't seem to how to proceed the working code is:

    rod down-right

    row_number2=row_number
    while row_number2 &lt;= row_length and column_number &lt;= column_length and rows[row_number2][column_number] != word[-1]:

             if rows[row_number2][column_number]==word[-1]:
             print(word,'down') 

of course each increment each different per direction but it results to an **IndexError: list index out of range.** The loop would still run when the row\_number2 reaches 2, even though the **row\_length**'s value is just 2 why does the loop keep going on?

    for word in negative_slopes:

So obviously it just prints the final word and its direction.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. I'll no longer be able to make free coupon codes with arbitrary restrictions. Instead I can:

* Make free codes that are only good for 3 days for an unlimited number of people (NOV2019FREE lasts until November 7, 2019 11:05 AM PST)
* Make codes that make the course cheap (but not cheaper than what Udemy offers, allowing them to undercut me) for unlimited people that lasts for 30 days. (I've made a code NOV2019 for this.)

There's two other options, but they're less than ideal: free but only 10 people can use it, or lowest price but it's only good for a few days instead of a month. I can only make 3 codes a month, so I can't just generate new codes every few days.

If you're reading this post after the NOV2019FREE code, you can use the NOV2019 code to get the course for about $14. I plan on making new free codes for the first three days of each month. You can probably guess what next month's free code will be.

To head off any questions:

* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.

Udemy's new policies mean I can't do this anymore. I find this to be a less than ideal situation. So I'm rolling out new codes each month. NOV2019FREE is the free code, and NOV2019 is the cheap code. I'll come out with new ones at the start of each month.

239,learnprogramming,bz3rys,AlSweigart,"The online course for ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" is free to sign up this week.",True,"School's out, but that doesn't mean you have to stop learning. The online video course from the author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" (that's me) is free to sign up for this week. This sign up will give you life time access to the course. Just use the following link:

https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=SCHOOLS_OUT

This course is made for complete beginners who have no experience programming. It's ""programming for office workers"" because it skips computer science and teaches you how to do practical tasks: web scraping, updating Excel spreadsheets, parsing PDFs and Word documents, sending out automated email and text notifications, controlling the mouse and keyboard, and more. If you're an experienced programming, you can skip the first half (which covers basic programming concepts) and directly learn about several useful modules for Python.

(This code expires on June14th. Previously I'd give out codes to folks who asked me after the expiration, but it turns into a logistical headache to keep making coupons each time someone asked, so the deadline is firm.)

During the month of December, you can also use DEC2019 to sign up for $14 instead of the usual $50: https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=DEC2019

Due to the way Udemy now does promotions, I'm limited in how many discount codes I can make each month, so there's no way for me to make more after the 72 hour period, which ends roughly Wednesday night 7pm Pacific time.

I'll have the second edition of the book in HTML format online, uh, soon. I've had some delays getting it ready. The online course follows the 1st edition, and I won't be able to update it until probably mid-2020. I'll write up a blog post about what exactly is new in the 2nd edition soon too. Go ahead and get started: the Udemy course is still useful.

This promo code works until Dec 26th. Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why this code only lasts 3 days. I won't be able to make codes after this period, but I will be making free codes in the future.

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code DEC2019 (or whatever month/year it is). I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $14 to $16. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, which means I don't get the credit for referral signups. Blerg.)

257,learnprogramming,oigbjn,Standardweasel,I got a job! At 39 years old and exactly 18 months from when I quit my marketing career.,True,"Huge thanks to this awesome reddit community. The number of times I googled something paired with the words “reddit learnprogramming” and got my answer, I can’t even count. You guys have taught me so much. So, I wanted to try to give back and detail everything I have learnt from the past 18 months (and 15-year career before this).

I’ll try and break this up into my learning journey and my job-hunting journey.

**Learning**

Below was basically my curriculum.

(But note that people learn differently. What works for me might not work for somebody else. I’m an auditory and a kinaesthetic learner. I recommend working out what learning style works for you. I’d also recommend two awesome books to read; Atomic Habits by James Clear and Ultralearning by Scott Young.)

Anyway, here’s what I did.

* Harvard CS50 (free)
   * This was awesome at nailing the fundamentals. David Malan is a great teacher and explains everything really well. I’d recommend doing this at the beginning of your journey if possible and do the projects. Warning though, it’s really hard. (It is “Harvard” remember) I say this so that you don’t get discouraged. It’s going to punish you. But try and push through the struggle.
* FreeCodeCamp (free)
   * I found FreeCodeCamp really enjoyable and the short, almost gamified lessons made it really easy to keep me motivated. I was having fun. I did find however that it was a little too hand-holdy for me and I found myself not retaining as much information as I would have liked. Many of the modules I had to do 2 or 3 times to fully grasp them.
* Tyler McGinnis’ React courses (now called [Ui.Dev](https://Ui.Dev))
   * He’s a great teacher but was a little advanced for me as a beginner. It’s more of an intermediate course. I’d probably be ready to do his courses again now.
* Grad Cert of Data Engineering (ANU)
   * I did this basically because it was being offered as a really cheap University short-course due to Covid. Although I did learn a lot of SQL, Python and Machine Learning, it was a pretty poor experience. (This is a whole different rant that I will spare you from) It also didn’t do much for me job wise, as it often confused hirers as to where I wanted my career trajectory to go. Not the best use of 9 months of my time.
* The Odin Project (free)
   * I found this to be really good. The perfect balance of guiding you to where you need to be without hand-holding. And it allows you to develop real world skills such as using an IDE, Git, Package Managers etc. If you're looking to get into web development, this is pretty much a one stop shop to get there. 
* Random other things that I found such as CodeWars (for algorithm practice), Flexbox Froggy, Automate the Boring Stuff and an assortment of YouTube videos (Programming with Mosh, Tim Corey(C#)), PluralSight and other random things that I don’t remember any more.

**Getting a Job**

I feel like I made a fair few mistakes here. So rather than detail exactly what I did, I'll make it about what I recommend you do...

* Focus on what will move the dial in relation to getting an interview. This is:
   * Resume/CV
   * Projects (to put in your Resume/CV and to talk about in your interview)
   * LinkedIn
   * Networking/Meetups
   * Personal website

**Resume**

* Optimise your resume/CV. This is the most important part of getting to the interview stage by far. Obsess over it. Get multiple people to review it. Make sure the people who are reviewing it know what they’re talking about. Pay an expert to do it if necessary. This is your number 1 asset. Your entire journey comes down to someone looking at this thing for around 8-12 seconds. It’s your one shot, so, make sure it’s as perfect as it can be. (If you'd like me to look at your resume, send me a DM)
* I won't go to much into what your resume should look like, but *make sure it's easy for them*. Make your resume skimmable, with clear sections, headings, subheadings, bullet-points. If you live in the area of the job you're applying for, make it clear that you live in that area and that you have valid working rights.
* Also, tailor your resume to each job you apply for. You don’t have to change it a heap, but, if you’re applying for a JavaScript job for example, make sure your resume is JavaScript focused.
* If you don’t have much experience, do some interesting projects (or at least one comprehensive one) and either add links from your resume, or if you’re short of space, from your personal website (and include your personal website link in your resume instead). Make sure these projects are easily viewable to the hirer. If you’re not looking for Web-Dev jobs and you can’t link to them, at least provide links to screenshots of them. Make sure they look good, as many hirers are not coders, and will judge your stuff on the aesthetics.

**Other**

* Read job descriptions carefully. Read them 4 or 5 times if you need to. Someone most likely put a lot of effort into it and it lists exactly what the company you are applying for is looking for. Then you can basically parrot this job description back to them in your own words, both in your cover letter and when tailoring your resume and it will sound to them like you are the exact person that they had in mind.
* Use LinkedIn. Optimise your LinkedIn profile the same way you do your resume.  Just watch this YouTube video from \[Danny Thompson\]([https://youtu.be/SG5Sb5WTV\_g](https://youtu.be/SG5Sb5WTV_g)) for everything you need to know in this regard. And connect with everyone relevant in your area.
* Apply for jobs through websites, but also try non-traditional routes. If you see a job on a website, try and find the contact on LinkedIn and send them a DM. Ask a simple question such as salary expectations. Sometimes this will get you an interview without having to go through the process whereby your resume is shoved in a pile with hundreds of others. Even if you don’t get a reply to your message, they’ll probably remember your name when they’re going through the pile which won’t hurt.
* Get out there and talk to people. Find meetups to go to in your area. Break out of your comfort-zone. Talk to people. It turns out, the people who go to these things are generally cool, passionate people who just love to share their knowledge and are excited about anyone who shows passion as well. I know you probably feel awkward and uncomfortable. Most people do. Do it anyway.
* Can’t find a meetup in your area? Create one! I actually started a Junior Developer meetup group in my area (Adelaide, Australia) because there wasn’t one. Now I know what you’re thinking. ""But I'm not the type of person who organises a meetup group!"". *Neither am I.* I was scared shitless(I still am). But I pushed through and did it anyway. Not only did it end up helping me land my first job, but I’m helping to grow the local tech community, making friends and helping other junior developers find jobs. *And* I conquered one of my biggest fears. It feels good.

**Interview**

**Preparing for an Interview**

* Again, read the job description carefully before your interview. Think about any questions they could ask in relation to the job description and prepare answers for them in your head.
* Research the company before going in. Check out their website. Learn what they're about. Practice for the question of ""What do you know about us?"" and ""Why do you want to work for this company?"" Prepare something in particular about something they have done or are doing. A specific feature they have implemented. (if you can't think of one, question whether you actually want to work for them) Nothing impresses the pants off of someone more than saying ""I read your white paper on blahblah and I love your focus on blahblah"".
* Prepare answers for the following:
   * Tell me about yourself. Usually this is just an icebreaker or they haven’t had time to read your resume. So prepare a story about your journey and try and make it interesting. Give it a story-arc (which should be fairly easy if you're going through this journey because you're no doubt going to have struggles and conflicts).
   * What’s a difficult situation you’ve had at work (or university if you haven’t had any experience) and how did you handle it?
   * What are your strengths.
   * What are your weaknesses. (People often struggle with this one. For this question don’t say things like “I work too hard”. State an actual weakness but then talk about how you have mitigated this weakness. For example I usually go with (which is true), “I don't really like thinking of them as weaknesses. I like to think of them more as 'Challenges'. Because when I become aware of a weakness I take steps to mitigate it. For example I'm naturally a pretty unorganised person, so I'm obsessive about my use of trello, evernote and other project management tools to help keep me organised”.)

**In the interview (non-technical part)**

* More than anything, generally the interviewer just wants to find out if you’d be someone that they would like to have around in the office. So, try to be friendly and confident but humble. Show that you’re passionate about the work and the potential for working there.
* Keep your answers short and sweet. More words don’t equal better answers. Don't waffle. Keeping them succinct shows confidence. End confidently. Try to avoid ending with ""...and.... uh..yeh...""
* Ask at least one question at the end. My go to question is ""Pretend you hired me for this role and we're 12 months from now... what would the outcome be where you would say ""Man.... I’m really glad we hired standardweasel"". I like this question because not only does it show that you're in it to help them achieve their goals, but it’s also good from your perspective to see 1: whether they've thought about this before and 2: Whether you think the goals they have in mind are achievable. (Remember it's a 2-way interview. You're also working out if this company is a good fit for you)

**In the interview (Technical part)**

* If you don't know the answer to something, don’t try and make things up. You’ll appear unconfident and will most likely dig yourself into a hole. Just say you don't know (but are willing and excited to learn).
* If you have a whiteboard test, talk through the problem. Generally, they want to hear your thought process more than your answer. Ask for hints if you need to. The interviewer usually wants to help you to get to the answer. Read ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for more help on this part.
* This isn’t my list, I believe I may have ripped it off another reddit poster a long time ago, but this is a checklist of things you should be prepared for if you’re going for one of these types of jobs. Note that many jobs (such as Front-end developer roles) will not require this. (For example for my job I was asked a simple FizzBuzz):

\- Data types

\- Basic Bitwise Operations

\- String Operations

\- Arrays

\- Linked Lists

\- Singly Linked

\- Doubly Linked

\- Circular Linked

\- Queues

\- Stacks

\- Heaps

\- Trees

\- Binary Trees

\- Binary Search Trees

\- Tries

\- Self Balancing Trees

\- Traversing Trees

\- Breadth First Search - BFS

\- Depth First Search - DFS

\- Preorder, Inorder, Postorder

\- Graphs

\- Dijkstra's Algorithm / A\* Search

\- Hash Maps

\- Handling Collisions

\- Sorting algorithms

\- Insertion

\- Selection

\- Merge

\- Quick

\- Time Complexities

\- Programming Paradigm

\- Dynamic Programming

\- Object Oriented Programming

\- Asynchronous Programming

\- Functional Programming

**Other Interview Tips**

* If you get nervous in interviews, practice actual live interviews where you don't care about the outcome. Nothing makes you better at interviews than doing a ton of them. If you're not getting that many interviews, apply for McDonalds or anywhere else that will give you an interview... anything to get practice. If you get the job you can always say no. The more interview you do, the more confident you'll get. It's the same as dating. And just like dating you should try to avoid 'One-itis’. Think of every interview as just a practice for the real thing. Opportunities (and interviews) are like buses, there's always another one around the corner.
* Don't take the interview process personally.
* I’m going to repeat this one because it’s really important and really hard to do. Don’t take the interview process personally. You’re going to get rejected. You’re going to get ghosted. It happens to everyone. *This isn’t a reflection on you*. Maybe they already had somebody in mind for the job and were required to interview due to regulations. Maybe they were looking for someone with less experience. Maybe they thought you were too smart and thought they'd steal your job. Maybe they hired their son. Maybe you just look like someone who stole their girlfriend/boyfriend in high-school. Just move on.

**Other**

* Don't let age stop you. From my experience I didn’t find there to be any age discrimination. Nobody looked twice at the fact that I am 39. In fact, the most common response was “That’s awesome”. If anything it was an advantage as it showed that I was passionate, determined and had soft skills that younger people wouldn’t have gained yet. My theory is that the age discrimination myth comes from 10-15 years ago, when the only people who were technological natives were young people and therefore you didn't really see many older people in tech. Whereas now anyone under 50 has pretty much grown up with technology in some form.
* Don't rush. You're probably going to want to churn through lessons and YouTube videos because you want to learn quicker. This only slows down the process. Make sure you understand what concept you are trying to learn. And then make sure you fully understand it before moving on to the next thing. Test yourself by trying to build something using the concept you're learning. Your brain is really good at tricking you into thinking you know something. There's a big difference between being able to follow along and understand something someone is doing on YouTube, compared to being able to actually implement it yourself. 
* It's hard to realise how much you're learning. Kind of like how you don't realise a person that you see everyday is ageing until you look back at old photos. After 18 months I often feel like I haven't learnt much, until I remember when I started I didn't even know what a JavaScript was. So try and remember where you came from.
* And trust the process. You’re going to feel like quitting. You’re going to have moments where you spent 5 hours debugging code only to realise you forgot a semi-colon. You’re going to feel like an idiot. \[You’re not stupid\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/n52d3g/youre\_not\_stupid\_an\_important\_aha\_moment\_i\_had/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/n52d3g/youre_not_stupid_an_important_aha_moment_i_had/)).",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/oigbjn/i_got_a_job_at_39_years_old_and_exactly_18_months/,154,2021/07/11-17:36:27

261,learnprogramming,o7gf56,Halmesn,"After 8 months of self-taught, I was approached by Netflix and interviewed for a senior position. I need your advice.",True,"Hi everyone, I thought it would be interesting to share this unique experience with you guys and I really need some further advice.

First of all, I'm a self-taught Front-End developer based in Brisbane Australia, I majored in Advertising art at Uni and used to be a digital media editor for 4 years. Last year, I decided to make a career change when the quarantine hit. 

So I began to learn Front-end development, after 8 months, I finished my first project, a Netflix clone without following any tutorial and I put it on Reddit for some feedback.

The post went viral beyond my expectations, it got more than 3k upvotes in less than 12 hours. The positive feedback I received was also overwhelming. Thanks again for the supports, all of you!

One day, I got a private message from a very kind and nice senior software engineer who is working at Netflix, he told me he was very impressed by my work and my passion. Also to my surprise, he afforded me the opportunity to have a chat directly with his manager who is based in NYC.

As a non-English speaker, I really can't describe the feeling accurately when I knew that as a self-taught, no-experience, my work was recognized by the real Netflix team. It felt like I'm having the sweetest dream in the world.

A few days later, I had a video interview with the manager. Oddly to me, the position title was 'senior software engineer' which I found out later that all software engineers at Netflix are seniors. 

The interview itself went well in my eyes. We talked about my experience, learning journey, passion for SE, and future learning plans, etc. At the end of the interview, the manager indicated the potential future steps would be technical interviews with engineers on coding challenges, homework, and algorithm/data structure whenever I feel ready.

That was when I realized I couldn't get this job at this moment because I know literally nothing about algorithm/data structure. And I have already heard that FAANG companies have really high requirements regards of how good their candidates are at algorithm/data structure.

I wish I could be a genius to know all of the knowledge in just 8 months of self-teaching and got this job. But in reality, I'm not.

I have to accept the hard truth that when the great opportunity came, I wasn't ready for it.

However, I think this experience is still priceless to me because now I know that myself has potential, and I want to become better and better so eventually, I can work at Netflix.

The question is how. What should I focus on next? My thought is that I'll keep job hunting in Australia and gain some solid real-world experience while starting to learn algorithm/data structure.

But how should I know when I'm ready? I mean this question may sound silly but I think everyone has imposter syndrome, I probably need more insights to keep me feeling confident.

I really need your advice. Thank you heaps in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/o7gf56/after_8_months_of_selftaught_i_was_approached_by/,3,2021/06/24-21:31:16

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021 or late-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

264,learnprogramming,o16f5a,cellularcone,From Depressed College Student to Data Engineer,True,"Two years ago, I didn’t have much to brag about. I had spent six years in undergrad bouncing around between humanities majors before settling on international relations. I know you’re probably saying international relations is useless. I knew that, but I was also struggling with crippling depression and anxiety. Anything remotely technical or career-oriented would send me into a state of panic. I found that out the hard way when I failed freshman year and nearly got kicked out of school. I had always been interested in programming ever since I booted up my dad’s old Macintosh II as a kid and played around with True Basic. The idea of actually doing it for a living though, or even in an academic setting terrified me. Obviously everyone else would be so far ahead of me there would be no way I could compete. 

Well, after graduating and immediately going back to school for a one-year masters in marketing (turns out it’s very difficult to get hired with an international relations degree), I found myself frequently looking up coding tutorials in class. After randomly selecting python because some Reddit thread suggested it, I spent most of my downtime between lectures doing basic courses on Udemy and eventually graduated to some random connect four tutorial. For some reason, I was actually absorbing and retaining information. 

When I graduated and eventually got my first shitty agency job, I tried to use python for every single thing I could. There were so many tedious reports that needed to be put together every day that required visiting dozens of media sites, copying data between spreadsheets and so on. It was the perfect opportunity to learn web-scraping and data manipulation with pandas. I ended up saving the office about two hours of work a day. Needless to say, my boss was very impressed. It was great until he got laid off, and his replacement quit. Then I got laid off too. 

I spent the next year and a half working at a media agency. While my official job title didn’t reflect it, I ended up being able to shift my responsibilities away from simple ad placement to finding ways to automate  campaign budget allocation and media upload / allocation as well as reporting. I even got a chance to create some data infrastructure as the company had none before my arrival.  

After failing to get any sort of raise, I decided to start applying to junior developer and data analyst jobs in my area. I would highlight all the technical aspects of my previous jobs in my applications and include my GitHub portfolio. After 50 something applications, I finally got a lead with a multi national logistics company for a data analyst position. The interview went well and they gave me a python and sql assessment which I went overboard on completing. 

It’s been four months since I put in my notice at my last job and I just passed my probation period as a data analyst / engineer with a 60% salary increase. Instead of rushing to meet deadlines for campaigns and mindlessly scrolling excel files I get to spend the work day building data pipelines and automating reports without someone breathing down my neck. 

TLDR Thanks to stack overflow, reddit, and a resume that only highlighted my technical achievements, I managed to go from a depressed college student to someone with a good job, a fiancé and a house (albeit rented). So that’s pretty cool I guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/o16f5a/from_depressed_college_student_to_data_engineer/,139,2021/06/16-07:38:59
265,learnprogramming,nyen17,Celiuu,3 things that has nothing to do with programming that made me a better programmer,True,"Hi,

Been talking to a friend who studies computer science at Harvard university. He is the best programmer I know, faster than most seniors at my work in terms of coding challenges. I spoke to him about wanting to be a better programmer, and I asked him what I could do to speed up my learning process as I'm already familiarizing myself with techniques such as Vim and upping my typing speed to 150 wpm. 

He told me that in order to be a better programmer, other than just programming, you need to have 3 skills.

1. **Take long walks without a phone**

What he really meant was learn to be patient. Take long walks for an hour or preferably longer with your own thought. Focus on your breathe, think about life and learn to be patient. The further from home the better. Just don't think about work or problems. 

2. **Make art**

He told me that you need to be creative. Programmers tend to be very analytic and sometimes stay in the box due to their lack of creative thinking. He suggests activating your right brain. Whether this is through music, painting, sculpting or any other form of creativity does not matter he suggests. 

3. **Work out**

There are multiple studies that prove that working out intensively 3 hours per week or longer can enhance memory significantly. I suggest going to *PubMed* and read the articles for yourself as there are tons that back this claim. 

Don't force yourself to do anything. I found his 3 ''rules'' to be true, and I also feel happier. Hope you learned something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/nyen17/3_things_that_has_nothing_to_do_with_programming/,203,2021/06/12-12:41:09

271,learnprogramming,koivx0,Celiuu,You're not too stupid for programming,True,"Hi,

For a year of computer science class I've always felt I was ''too stupid'' for programming. I've been looking up posts with people facing the same problems. A year of computer science, I've seen people progress ten, sometimes a hundred times faster than me. It would take me hours to figure out one function. I kid you not, I spend over a week working 8 hours a day trying to build a simple function where my POST function would stay on the same page using Ajax. I just assumed that I could copy code and it would all magically work in mine. 

The problem is not your brain. The problem is the way your brain is used to solving problems. Solving problems in programming is not the same as solving problems anywhere else. You can't just follow a cooking tutorial and cook the same. Your program is always somewhat different, and therefore has to be implemented different. 

So what did I do to get over ''being to stupid to code''. 

1. Clean your desk and work space.
2. Set a timer for the amount you'll program without distraction.
3. Work as simplistic as possible. Don't look up ''how to make an online registration form''. Instead start by learning about how you can register a single character into your database. Be as simplistic as possible. Baby steps. 
4. Spend 80% of the time reading and understanding your problem and solution. Don't write a letter of code until you fully understand it.
5. Now spend time testing your code in a raw file.
6. Now that you fully understand the code, that's where you implement it in your own. 

Good job. You're no longer ''too stupid to code''.

I'd like to thank everyone on Reddit and all the folks who have taken my course or read my programming books. I'm completely floored by the response I've gotten to this course. It's incredible and I feel so fortunate for being able to have such a large impact. As I write this, there are 999,866 folks who have signed up for my beginner programming course, so it looks like today, October 1st, 2021, will the day when I reach 1,000,000 sign ups. The vast majority of these are free sign ups. According to my metrics, only about 8% or so of students finish the course (about average for online courses).

But knowing that I've been able to teach roughly tens of thousands of folks to program really... gives me a satisfied sense that I'm useful. As Muhammad Ali put it, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for the room here on earth."" It's something I worry about a lot, but the number of people telling me they find my stuff useful is a great reassurance.

276,learnprogramming,ovo79y,Celiuu,"Before you quit your CS major, hear me out",True,"Recently got my CS bachelors and I'm one of those people who wanted to quit along with another 1/3rd of my class. But I stuck through it for a very specific reason, and this reason is also how I influenced others to stay, so I just want to share my thoughts on this. 

**Combine**

The beauty of computer science is much like business. You can combine it with *everything*. Knowing how to code is a skill you'll keep with you for the rest of your life, and unfortunately not everyone feels this way. I strongly believe that learning to code will benefit everyone, and especially those who start a business. Nearly every business requires at least a functional website and some form of analytical thinking. And those are skills that will be useful forever.

I started to hate coding. Not because I dislike coding but because I loved architecture so much more. So I simply combined and my passion for code was restored. For the past few days I've been hitting it off on Rhino trying to develop great plugins. Another friend of mine who also wanted to quit was obsessed with health &amp; diet. So he created a website, a blog and a phone app for health. He stuck all the way through, and now coding is his hobby despite him starting to strongly to dislike it.

**Conclusion**

Embrace how useful coding can be even if it's not your number one pick. If you're not in your first year, rethink your decision, and you'll probably have a very useful skill that you can combine for the rest of your life. While you combine it with your ''other passion''.

277,learnprogramming,pfc2d7,edgeofsanity76,Follow up post. Senior Software Engineer advice to newbies/juniors,True,"Firstly, thank you so much for all the kind comments regarding my post last week.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/patmv7/senior\_software\_engineer\_advice\_to\_junior/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/patmv7/senior_software_engineer_advice_to_junior/)

I offered up my discord Id so people could add me and chat about programming and get some advice if I can offer it. I've received over 200 requests and I have accepted all of them. I've been inundanted with questions, which has been great but also daunting. However, I'd like to address some common questions:

* Should I get a degree?
   * Yes you should, even though you don't technically need one for SOME jobs. It's always worth having.
* Can you help with C++ code?
   * A bit. I don't deal much with C++ as it's not required for my role
* Do you think data science is a good career choice?
   * Yes. We deal with data science bods all the time, but I don't code DS stuff.
* Do you have experience with embedded software and/or O/S development?
   * No sorry. I work in business software development. For the above, you should probably persue the CS degree too.
* Can you help me with this code?
   * Sure I can take a look and I can try to point you in the right direction. But I'm not going to completely fix it for you. That's my day job.
* What do you think of my CV/Resume?
   * I'll take a look. However, I don't have the priviledge of hiring/firing people. My advice would be to be informative but don't overload with information. Talk about YOU. Talk about your personality? What motivates you. What do you enjoy doing? Add a bit about personal interests. CV/Resumes are introductions to a person as well as an emloyee. Don't bore your future employer.
* Do you do any games development?
   * Yes in my spare time. I like to mess around with Unity and Unreal Engine.
* I'm 14 and want to persue a career in computers? What do you think I should do?
   * That is up to you. I'm not going to choose your career for you. Explore all the aspects of software development (Business, Embedded systems, O/S, game development) and choose what you think is a good fit.
* I'm paranoid my CS degree won't get my a software development job and I may have wasted my time.
   * Firstly you haven't wasted your time getting a degree. If you want to maximise your chances of getting a software job, start doing software development, like, now! Download the tools and just get on with it. Think of a project and start working on it.

I'm happy to chat to anyone, however my time is limited with work, family and just life in general. I also like to just chill out and play games (Battlefield anyone?).

278,learnprogramming,patmv7,edgeofsanity76,Senior Software Engineer advice to Junior developers and/or newbies (what to learn),True,"I work as a Senior Software Engineer in the UK and I'd like to lend my advice to new developers who are just starting out or what to become developers in the future. My experience is limited to the UK but may be applicable in other countries. And of course it varies on what you want to acheive as a software developer. My experience is in business and FinTech and I have been developing software professionally since the early 2000s and a lot has changed in that time. I am 44 and started programming when I was around 15. I started with Visual Basic and played around with Python and few other languages. But primarily I use C#, SQL using AWS and Azure platforms.

So anyway, here's an un-ordered list of things you should probably learn and why.

* Pick a language you like and get competent with it, don't fret the big stuff, just learn the basics. I would recommend a business focused language such as C# as it is very well supported.
* While doing the above, learn Dependency Injection at the same time.
* Start learning coding principles, such as SOLID, DRY, Agile software development practices. These will hold you in good stead in business. Many business use the Agile framework for project management, so learning how to code in an Agile manner will make things a lot easier for you and your team. I recommend reading the following books, all will give you good grounding common coding techniques in business
   * Clean Code and The Clean Coder both by Robert C. Marin (Uncle Bob), 
   * Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
   * Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide
   * Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
* Learn how to write behaviour based unit tests! Behaviour Driven Design will help ensure your code does what it is meant to do based on the business requirement. Learn how to write tests for your code by testing the abstraction and not the implementation. Test behaviour and expected results, now how those results are derived.
* You don't need a degree! If anyone tells you otherwise they are lying. The grads I have worked with, while knowledgable about computer science subjects, have been terrible coders. It's nice to know these things but most of the time some of the subjects are not all that relevant to business coding (as I said I am from a business background, so it is possible that if you want to go more indepth then a degree is most likely very useful). By all means get a degree if you want, but what you actually need to get started is experience. You only get this by coding and developing software, making mistakes and learning from them and learning from more experienced developers.
* Ask questions! ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS! It's the only way you are going to learn. There are no stupid questions. Don't be embarassed, be a pain in the ass! As a Senior I would be more concerned about devs NOT asking questions than those who constantly bug me. I want to be sure you are doing the best you can.
* Learn a cloud platform! Your code has to be hosted somewhere (if its not local) so learn a cloud platform such as Azure (recommended), AWS (somewhat recommended) or Google Cloud (meh!). Learning this kind of thing will really help in the dev ops world where you are responsible for coding AND deployment AND support. You will learn fast when you have to support your product.
* Learn Agile Scrum practices. A lot of businesses use this method to manage their projects. A good book on this subject is ""Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time"". It's pretty much essential, as the days of just coding what you want how you want are pretty much gone, especially in business. See coding practices above.
* Learn a datastore. This could be My/MSSQL, Mongo, Cosmos anything. You don't have to know it inside and out but an ability to create and run queries will be good, especially if you can do it in code.
* Learn security basics. Read up on OWASP and appreciate common methods of attacks on your code and learn how to mitigate the risks by coding defensively.

So thats a minimum I would expect from a dev in my team. But I would not expect them to know it all straight away. Just having a good awareness of the subjects and a willingness to learn.

Do your own projects and make it fun! Make a Git repo and show off your code. Coding makes you confident and learning from mistakes and remaining humble and willing to learn is the sign of a good developer. No one knows everything and ignore those that think they do! Even the experienced ones.

I hope this helps. Happy coding!",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/patmv7/senior_software_engineer_advice_to_junior/,345,2021/08/24-11:51:46

- Do you initially try recreating something simple you've done in another language
- Do you just dive in?

Often, learning things by yourself is harder than learning them in a formal setting because there is less structure.

Looking back to when we were self-learning web devs, there were nuances involved, it was more uncertain and we often lacked clarity regarding where we were going. We also remember wasting a lot of time spinning our wheels - getting nowhere.

After learning how to navigate these obstacles, we put together a roadmap and wanted to share it. We hope that it will help you break into the tech industry in one year or less, even if you don’t have a degree (or experience)!

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: APR2021FREE

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=APR2021FREE

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to APR2021FREE2 in three days.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)

293,learnprogramming,mez5xx,MikeDoesEverything,"From a Beginner to Beginners: Dealing with ""First Job Imposter Syndrome"", ""What project should I make?"", and an OOP Epiphany.",True,"Hello all,

Continuation of the ""From a Beginner to Beginners"" series where I document my learning journey through Python.  Skip to ""Actual Content"" if you want to skip the boring background stuff.

**Background**

I'm a, experienced traditional scientist (Chemistry, specifically synthesis on all scales) who went from zero coding experience to a full time programming position in 6-8 months via self taught material.  I taught myself Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS with Python being my main language.  I am in my 30's.

In total, I spent less than £100 on courses.  Here's a list:

* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming (~£20)

* Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery (~£20)

* Complete Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Bootcamp 2021 (~£20)

* Datacamp: Introduction to SQL (Free)

* Codewars SQL problems (Free)

I spent time building my own projects such as a program which automates mining cryptocurrency when my electricity is cheaper, email spam bots specifically targetting scammers, job application bot for LinkedIn (less than successful), a password manager, and my own website.

After that, I went into freelancing where I exclusively took on webscraping jobs.

**What I do now**

I work full time as a Data Engineer in the financial services sector in the UK.  My job involves turning data collection jobs which were manually carried out every day/month/other time period into automated pipelines using Python and cloud architecture.

**Note**

There were quite a lot of contributing factors into getting a job with the two most prominent being Data Engineeering is an absolutely booming industry right now and, of course, being in the right place at the right time aka lucky.  This is by no means a blueprint on how to get employed, this is my personal experience and yours may differ.

**Overview**

In this post we're going to deal the topics mentioned in the title.  Perhaps you're somebody who is asking yourself ""Am I really good enough?"" and a little nervous to enter the industry or you're just starting out and want to know what it's like taking on a career transition.  Either way, I hope this post has some value to you.

For those interested, here are the previous entries from the series in chronological order:

* [Going from print('Hello World)' to tutorial hell to building my own ""data pipeline""](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jwgatc/going_from_printhello_world_to_tutorial_hell_to/)

* [From a Beginner to Beginners: From building my own data pipeline to my first technical interview.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/l7drly/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_building_my_own/)

* [From print('Hello World!') to Tutorial Hell to Getting my First Job!](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lmi0zp/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)

**Actual Content**

**""But how do I know I'm good enough...?""**

This is all too common as self taught programmers as we often lack the foundation of a lot of computer science principles which CS grads typically have.  The answer to the question is ""You won't know until you try"" which sounds like a cop out, but it's true.  If you are experienced and feeling a little unsure about if you're a good enough applicant, I would invite you to be brave at this moment and throw out a few applications.

It was 4 weeks until I start my new job.  The first week of being offered it, I was on an adrenaline high.  I couldn't sleep and just wanted to get working.  Week two, I was getting a little nervous as I began overthinking with thoughts such as ""What if they got me confused with somebody else? Maybe they overestimated my skill level? I don't really even get OOP! WTF AM I DOING??"".  

By the third week, I was figuratively shitting myself going into this job.  

Although after I began, it really wasn't that bad.  There was a bit of a learning curve to learn serverless architecture although the principles are really the same as doing your own projects - version control via github, comment where necessary, and make sure your code is robust and easy to read i.e. no one letter variables, functions where necessary, and just make it so somebody who can at least read Python code can understand your logic.

**Project Based Learning is King**

If you can make your own projects, you're off to a good start.  If you make your own projects and publish them to github, even better because you'd be then writing code under the assumption other people are going to be able to see it so if you churn out something which works but is completely illegible, it can speak volumes to a potential employer.  I honestly think I'd be struggling in this job if I hadn't made any of my own projects or took any of the very underpaid jobs during freelancing.

From my personal experience in industry, a lot of isn't knowing the documentation in and out.  All of it is being able to justify why you're doing what you're doing and being able to get results.  This is where project based learning comes in - doing course after course will not teach you these abilities and exactly why if you've been learning for a bit and you're asking yourself, ""But what project should I do?"" or ""How do I make projects?"" you should make something.  Anything.  Challenge yourself to make *something* without copying an entire tutorial from start to finish.  It will suck, it will be hard, but you won't become a better programmer without feeling failure, and ultimately, success.

**When to OOP**

This is a fairly short bit about OOP because it's one of Python's biggest strengths although, like many others, I found myself wanting to use OOP for the sake of using OOP rather than really getting the point of it.

Long story short, OOP, like all coding paradigms, is situational.  Sometimes, procedural code is totally fine because that's all you need.  Don't feel bad if you're building something simple for your own use and it doesn't use OOP.

If you need something which is scalable and can be reused, use OOP.

I had to integrate that into React render() method and tie it all into callbacks that updated the objects if they were deleted directly from the table.

It wasn't that the task itself was that difficult, or required lots of experience, but that it was made up of many parts that were not directly linked to each other.

302,learnprogramming,lrcrxx,roonishpower,To make career-planning less confusing while learning to code and I made a website with over 50 CS career roadmaps!,True,"Hey folks! Four years ago as I was learning to code, I was frustrated about my lack of clarity about where to go and whom to learn from. With overwhelming career choices within tech and everchanging programming languages and frameworks, the first few months were painfully hard for me.

Six months ago I decided to revisit this problem again and came to learnprogramming to talk with folks to see if they still faced this problem and they very much did. To solve this, I decided to build a web-app to curate and share learning roadmaps where people who are new to coding can have more clarity regarding how to go about building their tech career and hopefully not face the problems which I did.

I managed to get over 50 learning roadmaps on a variety of careers and programming languages which I gathered from my friends, network and the internet and it's only increasing by the day! If you want to give back to the community, feel free to build your own roadmap and share your journey with the people starting out! I'd love your feedback and your criticism to know how I could make this better.

303,learnprogramming,lnr6v7,ConsciousCog1,Feeling stupid,True,"Hey guys, it’s just one of those days. I’m currently working at as a software developer co-op at a large corporation in my home city. Everything had been going great but I’m just getting that typical imposters syndrome hard today. I’m mobbing with some other devs and they are super nice and even say things like “don’t worry we’ve all been where you are” as a beginner but I can’t seem to help getting over this feeling of being unusually stupid. Like I’m never going to understand the mountain of new information. I’m currently learning unit testing on backend authorization and api calls and whenever I take a turn to code myself I end up having them just tell me what to code. I’m learning a ton but when I get ton I feel like a waste of space. Again, they are super nice and stuff I just don’t know how to stop letting my own insecurities get in the way of learning more and pushing myself. Any advice on how to try and ignore those inner thoughts so that I can work harder and not post whiney messages on Reddit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lnr6v7/feeling_stupid/,1,2021/02/19-13:44:26
304,learnprogramming,lhqgnz,ConsciousCog1,Just a simple piece of advice as I code more every day.,True,"I noticed when I first started learning to code in school, I had this assumption that people coded “fast”, as in typing brand new code from scratch quickly. I just wanted to let people know who are starting out that this isn’t always the case, and that you shouldn’t worry about it. It’s far more important to understand what you’re wanting to code before you code it. That takes time and patience. I notice I write much better, more accurate code when I am calm and take my time to think about every line I write and what it’s doing. Segmentation is key! Break EVERYTHING down to it’s simplest form, and don’t panic when you feel stupid or think you’re still on an “easy” lesson. Coding has taught me patience more than anything else in my life. If you can enjoy the ride as much or more then the actual outcome (because you should know the desired outcome intimately by that point) then you are on a good path.

This might not help with source code much, but the visual education you get from this tutorial is amazing (I think only auto fill is missing, to be honest.) This tutorial is for CSS grid learners who need a quick reference of all features. I think it's great for beginners.

306,learnprogramming,lmi0zp,MikeDoesEverything,From a Beginner to Beginners: From print('Hello World!') to Tutorial Hell to Getting my First Job!,True,"Hello all,

It finally happened! I became employed as a Data Engineer after self studying Python for around 8 months and SQL for around a month or two.  For reference, I'm based in the UK.  

I lost my job as a traditional scientist around August last year and had been at the mercy of a company doing data science/engineering incorrectly (overfitted models, zero subject matter expertise, dog shit data).  So, I took it upon myself to teach myself and prove they were doing it wrong.  Little did I know, I ended up discovering something I really enjoyed - making sure everybody is getting the right data.

After around 2 months of applying for jobs, I was contacted out of the blue by a company's HR department which was local who were looking for somebody to join their team as a Data Engineer.  This was pretty much nothing to do with my skill level and was 99% luck and being in the right place at the right time as the technical questions weren't as hard as other roles and the role itself is very new in the company.  I say nothing to do with my skill level because I really don't think I'm qualified for this job yet.

I had a total of 5 interviews:

* Data Engineer (webscraping)
 
* Python Developer/Consultant (I still don't really know what this job is, I took the interview because it was an interview)

* Test Automation Engineer

* Data Engineer (business intelligence)

* Data Engineer (financial services)

All of that aside, I think it's worth going over some stuff which might useful.  A lot of the skills in the learn programming subreddits are often a technical discussion and help.  Even from a science background there's a lot of similarities in the job search - the assumption good skills alone are enough to land the job.  Unfortunately, due to an influx of anybody being able to call themselves a recruiter, job hunting is definitely another skill that all programmers looking to get their job should learn in order to navigate getting strong armed into less than desirable positions for less than desirable conditions.

I was unemployed back in the tail end of the 2008 financial crash as well and, over time, I realised having the experience of job hunting and dealing with job specs, interviews, offers, recruiters was extremely helpful.  I completely understand that a lot of people in here may have never been in full time employment before so I thought it'd be useful to highlight what's still relevant:

**Culture, Prospects, Location, Money**

I would say these are pretty much the things that should drive your decision to get a job.

* You want to work with fun, decent people in a place which don't think you're a robot.

* You want a job which can either take you places at that company or kick start your career.

* It has to be somewhere you don't hate living.

* You want to get paid fairly.

Of course, not everything is set in stone and it's very much recommended to decide what you skimp on.  I'll echo something I learnt in science - offering to be paid less than the market value might help you now, but really hurts the industry as a whole.  Know your worth and stick to it.

For reference, here's the lowdown on a job I turned down vs the job I accepted:

Turned down:

* Recruiter constantly asked me the same questions over and over again (is the location okay because you live far away and are you sure you have experience using Python to which I answered yes)

* I did 3 interviews for them.  First stage was a classic verbal interview where the director literally left on the minute of the time we had allocated for the interview, cutting me off mid sentence.  Second stage was a technical task which I received feedback of ""not being great"" (this was because it was below the level of a developer.  At no point did I say, or suggest, I was at a developer level.  I was also applying for a junior level role) although invited me back for a third interview.  Third interview was a series of quick fire technical questions with right/wrong answers.  This whole process took 5 weeks.

* Spent another 2 weeks telling me they were still looking at other candidates.  So we are at 7 weeks for an interview process.

* Threw me an offer mid week and wanted me to start Monday.

At the beginning, I was so excited for this job although over time began to despair that this is the only job I might get.  Took all of this shite on the chin anyway and began planning my exit strategy.  Fortunately, a different job came through:

* Interview was carried out as a HR staff member found my CV directly on LinkedIn, emailed, and called me to schedule an interview.

* Manager was extremely personable and interested in hearing my motivations, giving me plenty of time to express myself.  Also over ran the interview by ten minutes as we were getting along.  They called me back on the within two hours to arrange a second stage interview.

* Second stage interview was with said manager and the analytics director.  Same format of being relaxed and asking a mix of scenario and experience based questions in order to see my approach to solving problems rather than how well I knew the documentation.  They also took the time at the end of the interview to get to know me more which was a really positive sign.

* I was offered the job about 3 hours after the second stage with an explicit instruction I'll be mostly working from home for the forseeable future and my start date will be at the very earliest in two weeks.

* This whole interview process took one week.

The relief and joy I experienced when I got this job was immense and made me realise that being desperate is a dangerous thing.

**Know What You're Looking For**

Googling is a highly underrated skill and it can be pretty crazy seeing people who are amazing at Googling for solutions to programming problems although completely forget all of that whilst job hunting.

What not to search for:

* Software developer jobs london

* Software engineer jobs wales

These are honestly the worst things you can search for because they will give you every result for every language and you'll spend a lot of time sifting through shite you don't want to apply for.

How you should search:

* Language + developer/engineer/general job title + location + jobs

* e.g. javascript front end developer new york city jobs

**Sometimes, It's Better to be Lucky Than Be Good**

I mentioned earlier getting the position I did was not about skill and more about being in the right place and that's something I want to touch on here.

In the end, as self taught programmers, university graduates, and people looking to change careers, all we want is a chance to prove ourselves.  In order to get that chance, you might have to face a few rejections and apply for stuff you might not necessarily be qualified for *right now*.  Although, if you honestly believe it's a job you can do given some time and training and you want to prove that, then every time you see a job application, just send your CV/resume in.  It doesn't cost anything and the worst thing that happens is they say no and you aren't ready yet.

Mindset whilst jobhunting is just as important as technical ability because with a weak mindset, you'll never get the opportunity to show what you're really good at.

I hope this was useful to somebody and good luck with everybody also looking to get their first job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lmi0zp/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/,166,2021/02/18-00:37:46

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to FEB2021FREE2 in three days.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

For example, if you're reading something along the lines of...

""Log the callback for the eventlistener function and parse the JSON."", and you don't understand what this means.. don't take it personally. 

Read the sentence carefully and you'll realise there's a concept that has been abstracted to a level that you're not up to yet. Read each word carefully.. Do you truly understand what an eventlistener is. A callback? A JSON? A function? Parsing? Work out what you don't understand and grok it until you can ELI5 it. Keep doing this and everything will become clear. 

If this is happening a lot to you then you're rushing the process. Remember, you're not saving any time by skipping over things.

    wget -O- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
in the terminal, but whenever I do that, I get this errors.

    Cannot write to ‘-’ (Success).
    sh: line 9: apt-get: command not found
    sh: line 12: apt-get: command not found

Anybody have any tips? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/iwom5p/upskill_courses_installing_heroku/,2,2020/09/20-16:14:00

I tried to make everything in this Notion page as beginner-friendly and organized as possible. I hope it'll be easy to follow for anyone who's trying to learn Git and GitHub.

In my opinion, learning to code feels fun and more meaningful when one maintains a repository where they upload projects/programs/scripts as they learn newer things and undertake new projects to practice what they've learned. The idea itself of maintaining and completing projects on GitHub makes one feel motivated to keep on learning. It gives one a sense of working towards an objective or goal. And this is why I started to learn Git and GitHub in the middle of when I just started learning Python.

I had to struggle quite a bit in learning Git and GitHub, and I also see many people, especially people who just started to learn code and any programming syntax, who struggle a lot in grasping the different features, commands, and concepts of Git and GitHub.
I think learning about Git and GitHub can be a little difficult for absolute beginners primarily because of how scattered the relevant learning materials are on the internet, and almost everything is explained or written using jargon and concepts that normally a person with minimum programming knowledge would understand.


And so, this Notion page is just an attempt of mine to consolidate everything into one place. It took me some time to organize everything, but it'll be worthwhile if this Notion page can serve as a resource to anybody in any way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/k2us9x/i_made_a_notion_page_you_could_call_it_a_guide/,103,2020/11/28-12:17:01

Let:  
n= val  


T(n) = T(n/2.0)

when n&lt; 1.0 ; T(n) = O(1)

I put myself through an information systems degree at university, and will be taking my last class coming January. I’m also starting a co-op in January full time as a software developer. I’ve taken a few coding classes but still feel like I haven’t learned much because my school is pretty terrible at teaching coding. I got this competitive co-op at a really good company and just feel like an imposter. Like I convinced them I’m better at coding than I am just because me and a classmate did a project on React and I’m helping make a website for the IT club. I don’t do much on my own, I don’t see the point when there seems to be an app for everything, but I’m still slowly working through The Odin Project and really enjoy it. My question is, has anyone had experience in a co-op? It’s a lot more than an internship cuz apparently I will be dropped straight into a team and be a full team member. That’s what scares me. I don’t feel like I know nearly enough or have nearly enough experience to even be in a co-op. I don’t even really know JavaScript.

347,learnpython,d7p6am,Monsi_Boy,Coding a Word Search Program in Python,True," 0

1st problem coordinate 'compiler':

I am practically a newbie in python, and I was tasked to create a word search program in python. As of now I can find the coordinates of a certain character given a board, but it finds ALL instances of the characters. A I would really appreciate some help!

2nd problem:

I tried to progress on the code to not waste time. But I have no idea how to go on. After, supposedly getting the coordinates the code must also state the word's direction (e.g right,left,down-left,up-left,down-right,up-right). I have no idea on I would get this. I was thinking about using slope to determine the direction but I have been running around circles on how exactly I would be translating this into a python code. Thank you so much in advance for your help!

I have already tried restricting to having only one character taken per row, but I realize this won't do since multiple words can be in the same row. Really hit a dead end here.

So basically this is the section that gets the coordinates of the first letter of the given 'words' in the board.

    words=['row', 'war', 'raw','rar','dew','rod','red']
    rows= ['rar', 'aoe', 'wed',]#rows in the board
    for row_number, row in enumerate(rows): 
        for column_number, letter in enumerate(row):
             for word in words: 
                if word[0]==letter: print(letter,(column_number+1,row_number+1))

1st problem:

The code gives me an output of:

    r (1, 1)
    r (1, 1)
    r (1, 1)
    r (1, 1)
    r (1, 1)
    r (3, 1)
    r (3, 1)
    r (3, 1)
    r (3, 1)
    r (3, 1)
    w (1, 3)
    d (3, 3)

As could see the coordinates are really not that helpful. It seems that it just keep finding the same letter again and again How would I fix this? 

2nd problem:

I was hoping to produce the output:

    word(x,y)-direction

The (x,y) coordinate is somehow almost done and I think I can store the solutions the only problem left now is how I would determine the direction. Thanks again for the help!  


  
Note:  
In this case the words only go down, but this is just the case to simplify the coding process. The code must be able to find the words",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/d7p6am/coding_a_word_search_program_in_python/,9,2019/09/22-04:26:06

                                     print(word,'down')

of course each increment each different per direction but it results to an **IndexError: list index out of range.** The loop would still run when the row\_number2 reaches 2, even though the **row\_length**'s value is just 2 why does the loop keep going on?

Some of the themes I'll cover are:

* How to avoid ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style code, which depends on flow control instead of data structures.
* How to remove duplicate code (and why you'd want to).
* When you should replace multiple variables with a list or dictionary.
* How you can save yourself effort by using the Python standard library.

If you have programs you'd like to see me refactor, feel free to PM me or post as a comment here your pastebin.com link. To make sure the audience can follow along and it's easy to stream, I'd like to ask that they:

* Generally be between 10 and 300 lines of code in a single file.
* Only use the Python standard library and not require additional modules.
* Not require additional files, like files that need to be on your computer, or account info or special permissions or environment setups.

356,learnpython,pqow4a,MikeDoesEverything,Stream download large JSONs from API - figuring out the right library and mechanism?,True,"Hello,

I'm currently creating a pipeline to download files from an API into cloud storage.  

* These are in a JSON format and around 90+MBs per file in size and 10-20 files total.

* The API is paginated, so I'm calling all of the endpoints for the relevant endpoint and downloading all of the JSONs.

What I'm currently doing is this:

    response = requests.get(url=api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    if response.ok:
        data = response.json()
        with open(path to blob storage using smart_open library) as file: 
              json.dump(data, file)

Obviously this is taking forever.  Ideally, I want to have this done by a serverless function although I'm struggling to find the right strategy to speed this up and be less memory intensive.  

The idea I have so far:

Convert the `json` into a generator object and then parse it bit by bit into cloud storage:

    response = requests.get(url=api_endpoint, headers=headers)
        if response.ok:
            with open(path to blob storage using smart_open library) as file:
                  # generator object function here, yields JSON
                  for piece in generator object: 
                      json.dump(piece, file)
    
Other than that, I'm not really sure what to do.  I think I want to stream from the API into the target file in the cloud however I'm struggling to get my head around syntax and libraries for streaming data from one place to another.

Fundamentally, I'd like to be able to ingest up to 1GB of JSON files using a serverless function written in Python in an efficient manner.  Alternatively, any other method of getting this data into cloud storage would be great.  If it helps, the platform I'm using is Azure.

367,learnpython,o16gvr,cellularcone,I Actually Got a Job!,True,"Two years ago, I didn’t have much to brag about. I had spent six years in undergrad bouncing around between humanities majors before settling on international relations. I know you’re probably saying international relations is useless. I knew that, but I was also struggling with crippling depression and anxiety. Anything remotely technical or career-oriented would send me into a state of panic. I found that out the hard way when I failed freshman year and nearly got kicked out of school. I had always been interested in programming ever since I booted up my dad’s old Macintosh II as a kid and played around with True Basic. The idea of actually doing it for a living though, or even in an academic setting terrified me. Obviously everyone else would be so far ahead of me there would be no way I could compete. 

Well, after graduating and immediately going back to school for a one-year masters in marketing (turns out it’s very difficult to get hired with an international relations degree), I found myself frequently looking up coding tutorials in class. After randomly selecting python because some Reddit thread suggested it, I spent most of my downtime between lectures doing basic courses on Udemy and eventually graduated to some random connect four tutorial. For some reason, I was actually absorbing and retaining information. 

When I graduated and eventually got my first shitty agency job, I tried to use python for every single thing I could. There were so many tedious reports that needed to be put together every day that required visiting dozens of media sites, copying data between spreadsheets and so on. It was the perfect opportunity to learn web-scraping and data manipulation with pandas. I ended up saving the office about two hours of work a day. Needless to say, my boss was very impressed. It was great until he got laid off, and his replacement quit. Then I got laid off too. 

I spent the next year and a half working at a media agency. While my official job title didn’t reflect it, I ended up being able to shift my responsibilities away from simple ad placement to finding ways to automate  campaign budget allocation and media upload / allocation as well as reporting. I even got a chance to create some data infrastructure as the company had none before my arrival.  

After failing to get any sort of raise, I decided to start applying to junior developer and data analyst jobs in my area. I would highlight all the technical aspects of my previous jobs in my applications and include my GitHub portfolio. After 50 something applications, I finally got a lead with a multi national logistics company for a data analyst position. The interview went well and they gave me a python and sql assessment which I went overboard on completing. 

It’s been four months since I put in my notice at my last job and I just passed my probation period as a data analyst / engineer with a 60% salary increase. Instead of rushing to meet deadlines for campaigns and mindlessly scrolling excel files I get to spend the work day building data pipelines and automating reports without someone breathing down my neck. 

TLDR Thanks to stack overflow, reddit, and a resume that only highlighted my technical achievements, I managed to go from a depressed college student to someone with a good job, a fiancé and a house (albeit rented). So that’s pretty cool I guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/o16gvr/i_actually_got_a_job/,144,2021/06/16-07:41:07

    # BUGS:
    # 1. Not concluding tie as a tie and starting infinite loop.
    #   CAUSE: Function code
    #   STATUS: Complete
    #   FIX: Some code I found online and IDK why it works and why it different from mine but it works
    # 2. Taking multple turns but only making one move.
    #   CAUSE: Random select variables are taken, so it keeps doing the loop until found one that != ""X"" or != ""O""
    #   STATUS: Complete
    #   FIX: If spot is taken, keep generating new spot until empty one is found all in one turn.

So that is the code. Although my problem specifically occurs at: 

    # Recursive function
    # boxes, player
    # Check if there's a winning move, if there is play it
    # If there isn't, try a different move, and see if the opponent will win with that move
    def checkFork(boxes, player, lastmove):
      winning, x, y = checkMove(boxes, player)
      if winning:
        return lastmove, player
      else:
        for i in range(3):
          for j in range(3):
            boxCopy = copy.deepcopy(boxes)
            boxCopy[i][j] = player
            if player == ""X"":
              player = ""O""
            else:
              player = ""X""
            return checkFork(boxCopy, player, (i, j))

I don't know what to do from here. I don't really get how this works. The function is not finished, I have to add more code. But I don't know what code to add. If you could help me visualize how this works better then that would help a lot. My friend helped me with this, but he lost power so he can't help.

Python led me to a place in life I never knew would become possible. It has gotten me through tough times, entertained me, given me food and shelter, and most of all, given me joy. Sometimes I remember when I was watching those Tech With Tim tutorials on Youtube. So big thanks to Tim(Tech With Tim) also! Following his and a few other YouTubers tutorials, I have tried tons of different stuff like game dev, web dev, desktop application dev, scripting, AI, and more.

About 3 months ago, I watched Tech With Tim's series on Kivy. Kivy is a library for Python that allows Python devs to create mobile apps using Python, instead of languages like JS, Swift, etc. Before then, I had been using Sublime. Although it had been getting very messy(For my likings) with file explorer, cmd prompt, Sublime, and Chrome all open on my small laptop screen. So I downloaded PyCharm so I could have all my tools in one application. Well lemme tell you, PyCharm is INSANE. It really speeds up dev time with all those features. I tried Kivy out a bit and got a little confused. Not confused about how to do it, but confused about how I loved it so much. Before, I HATED web dev, desktop dev, so on. I thought I just hated front end development and was going to focus on AI, scripting, and overall software engineering. But somehow I became obsessed with Kivy.

I kept practicing and practicing, teaching myself the ropes. I never once thought about taking a break from Kivy, I just kept programming. It was 2 days until December, and I made a decision that would change my life forever. I decided I would start making money with my code. I considered this before but never could decide what I would code, and how I would make money. I didn't want a full-time job because I had no degree and I liked my current job. But now that I found Kivy, I knew I wanted to do mobile dev. I signed up for Fiverr and put up a simple gig post. I ended up getting two sales, but that motivated me. I recently signed up for Upwork, and I've gotten a few jobs. This is fine because for me it's about the coding, not the money.

Why am I sharing this with you? Simple, to thank all of you for helping me get to this place. I wouldn't know how to program without this subreddit. So again thank you. I wish I could do something more to thank all of you. For all those new Pythonistas, I hope this motivates you. I hope this lets you see the light at the end of the tunnel.

396,learnpython,l7drly,MikeDoesEverything,From a Beginner to Beginners: From building my own data pipeline to my first technical interview.,True,"Hello /r/learnpython,

I'm a traditional scientist who has always loved tech and finally began learning Python just under a year ago.  I have previously written posts on:

* [Completing my first job on Upwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jrwi6d/just_completed_my_first_job_on_upwork/)

* [Going from print('Hello World!') to building my own data pipeline.]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jwgatc/going_from_printhello_world_to_tutorial_hell_to/)

I have also since then completed a very short, free coding bootcamp which, to be honest, sounds much more significant than it was as I often felt significantly ahead of the course material.  I was by extreme fortune contacted out of the blue by a recruiter hiring for a role which involved webscraping.  I have to say at this point, this was literally a dream job I've been searching for.

I was a complete wreck and began telling my partner how we were going to rebuild our lives after I lost my job during the pandemic.  She brought me down to earth before the first stage and I instantly lost my shit when I got invited to the second stage.  So, all I had to do was a technical challenge involving the following objectives:

* Scrape a website

* Create a data pipeline which is future proofed, clean, and scalable.

Should be easy, right? I've done this before, right?  Not exactly, but here's what I built:

* Creates a filename based on what is being scraped.

* Checks if there is an existing directory of products with the file name.  If so, creates a catalogue of existing products.  If not, carries on.

* A program which scrapes the specified website.

* Parses the data.

* Checks against the existing products catalogue.  Adds unique entries to a CSV.

* Cleans the CSV in Pandas which can then be fed into a database.

* After the program has finished running, creates a metric report logging the time and date the program ran, what it scraped, and how many products were added to the database.

I haven't slept much and it's definitely not perfect but this is the coolest thing I've ever built and I wanted to share what I discovered from the past few weeks.

**Wtf is modular code**

My previous code has always been for me and for me only.  Huge blocks of unwieldy code with absolutely zero concept of future proofing of cleanliness, strict linting etc etc.  They specified clean, future proofed, flexible code.  So, for the first time ever, I created a separate file holding all of my functions and cursed my past self for thinking, 'OOP is actually a waste of time lmao'.  Only after I spent all that time converting my huge chunk of code into functions, I realised that I can change loads of shit and not completely rek everything else in the chain.  It was quite the revelation.

The sooner you get into the habit of producing future proofed, functional code, the better.  It makes a huge difference in terms of housekeeping and also not knackering your code entirely when you make changes.

**DB.  PANDA THIS**

(Yes, this is a Mitchjones reference.)

Had some genuine appreciation for the Pandas library as I had to create a solution which was also scalable.  So, naturally, I'm thinking a million or more rows, thus, Pandas is the best bet and it worked out really well...after banging my head against every solution possible.  The one thing I couldn't do successfully was just add stuff to the bottom of the file, like in csv writer.  The only thing I could do was rewrite the whole file and I don't know if it really matters.  What I do know is that I can totally get is if you have something with a shitload of rows (like a database), then definitely take the time to learn Pandas.  As there are quite a lot of aspiring Data Scientists in this subreddit, I thoroughly recommend getting to grips with Pandas earlier rather than later because I still don't know tons about Pandas although wish I did.

A very brief aside, I wanted to iterate these points from the bootcamp:

**Github Repos Make a Difference**

During the coding bootcamp, there was something extremely obvious - the people who were stuck in tutorial hell.  This was obvious because they were people who were either trained in other languages and learning Python for the first time, or people who knew Python well (could read and troubleshoot code, name popular libraries etc etc).  The strange thing about both of these categories of people is that they had one thing in common...

They had zero proof they knew Python outside of the course.  They all knew code, however, it seemed like none of them built anything by themselves in their spare time.

Call me shrewd, however, don't forget at the end of the day some of us are looking to make a career out of this.  My advice here is build your github because you never know when you're going to be up against somebody with a stacked portfolio, so you may as well be that person.

I'll most likely write another post once I get a decision on this job.  If anybody has any questions about anything, I'd be happy to answer with my limited knowledge.

I am looking into a project for my company that would be very helpful and save about 2 days of work per month. I am a “pandas programmer”, am currently learning OOP and while I want to wait until I learn OOP to do this…duty calls (and year end review is approaching).

We have a year of credit card expenses manually coded by a user, I want to use that data to code future expenses based off of how we’ve coded expenses from that merchant in the past. Example, we have coded “AMAZON” to “office expense” 95% of the time, any merchant charges with “Amazon” will be assigned “ office expense.

I imagine this is possible, but my question is: does this cross into machine learning? I just want to be sure I’m not over promising and under delivering here before I start the conversation.

It's incredible and I feel so fortunate for being able to have such a large impact. As I write this, there are 999,866 folks who have signed up for my beginner programming course, so it looks like today, October 1st, 2021, will the day when I reach 1,000,000 sign ups. The vast majority of these are free sign ups. According to my metrics, only about 8% or so of students finish the course (about average for online courses).

But knowing that I've been able to teach roughly tens of thousands of folks to program really... gives me a satisfied sense that I'm useful. As Muhammad Ali put it, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for the room here on earth."" It's something I worry about a lot, but the number of people telling me they find my stuff useful is a great reassurance.

412,learnpython,mivbxe,NotTreeFiddy,"I was finally hired as a junior software developer, and it only took me.... seven years! Here's a quick write up on my journey for those on a similar path.",True,"I began learning to ""code"" when I was a teenager. I got very into the scene of making websites for hosting sprite comics (despite making no more than two or three strips in my life time ha). I spent time at htmldog learning HTML, and the very basics of CSS but actually spent more time in Photoshop creating layouts and splicing them up. I then learned more of CSS as I moved on to creating templates for forums (do we all recall proboards for our favourite video games, hobbies and tv shows?). During this time, I also learned some JavaScript and ActionScript (because no worthwhile site at the time didn't have a flash based splash screen). This all stopped at the ripe old age of 16.

Flash forward to my early twenties. I got the urge to pick up programming again, with the idea of learning to become a web developer (mostly as a hobby). I did however, have an awful ""career"" in retail and was hopeful I might one day be able to transition into a programming career. It was at this time I also discovered Python (thanks Reddit). I spent the next 12 months learning both webdev skills (html, css frameworks and now properly learning JavaScript) and slowly falling in love with Python. I subscribed to every Python subreddit, forum, learning resource and YouTube channel I could find. In particular I went through the entirety of Learn Python the Hard Way, which gave me a solid foundation and also went through the Codecademy track and FreeCodeCamp.

Unfortunately, this was the point that I fell into tutorial hell. I became completely reliant on tutorials. I wasn't able to think up projects and implement them by myself. All I could do was follow a tutorial from beginning to end (and not even always to the end), and honestly not understand half the code that I was typing. I did make a conscious effort not to copy and paste code, but without truly understanding what the code I was typing did, it didn't really make much difference. This began a yearly cycle of ""getting into"" Python, following tutorials until I burned out, not learning much and then just stopping. This rinse and repeat process happened over and over until I hit my late twenties.

I had spent literally years wanting to be a professional developer, but had never felt confident enough in my skills to go for it. I occasionally sent out a job application for junior positions hoping they'd take me on in the form of an apprenticeship, but looking back I can see just how laughable my applications were. I had _nothing_ to show in the form of a portfolio. Nothing that wasn't just a rehashed tutorial project with a few variable names changed and some different choices of colours. During this period, I did manage to escape the dreaded world of retail. I landed a customer service position in Supply Chain for a large company, and from this managed to form a real career working through the various departments that existed there. This was great for my self-confidence and my wallet, but it absolutely did not excite me. 

I had started doing things like Project Euler, Advent of Code and other similar coding challenges, and I found that I loved them. They gave me a challenge without many clues of how to solve it, and I had to just go at it with Python to try and get a solution. Obviously, I would get stuck and then hit the search engines, but this was one of the greatest lessons I had every learned - it is okay to search for the gaps in your knowledge. These challenges pushed me to learn all kinds of programming concepts I'd never really come across before, and they did it in the form of a game. I learned about recursion, regex, proper uses of functions, classes and dictionaries (and creative ways to iterate through them) and so much more. Best of all, once I'd solved these problems I'd head over to their communities and look at other peoples solutions. This was a game-changer. Now I could see how my brute-forced (but successful) attempts were clumsy, and how I could have written them more elegantly and efficiently. I'd go through this very positive feedback loop of solving these problems, searching when I needed help and then comparing with others and repeating, and it felt great. Eventually, I realised that I'd built up enough skills doing this that I could actually automate a few of the more boring tasks at work. I read through the highly recommended 'Automate the Boring Stuff' by Al Sweigart and off I went.

In about 12 months I had automated nearly every report I had involvement with, automated all date collection from our various suppliers and customers, and even managed to use PyAutoGUI to automate some of the mind numbing and repetitive tasks I had to do in SAP (where I was only allowed access to the GUI, no scripting...). I created a few Flask apps that allowed me to do some of this and share a bit of it with some close co-workers too, but mostly I kept this to myself. Early on in the process of doing Project Euler I had created a GitHub to host my solutions, so I regularly added and updated my scripts on there to.

At this point, I had completely fallen in love with programming. I wanted more. I needed more. I knew at this point, that I would only become more miserable in my current career and decided at this point that I would aim to gain employment in a junior software position within 12 months. And then COVID came... This was a blessing and a curse. The job market became a mixture of stagnant and more competitive due to all of the lay-offs. But I had way more time on my hands thanks to permanent remote working. During this time I threw together a few simple web dev projects so I had something of a portfolio, but more importantly I tidied up all of the scripts I'd been using at work and threw on some READMEs explaining what they do and why I'd created them. I sent out regular job applications during this time, for all kinds of positions. Then in January, it happened. 

I applied to a small company that specialises in open source software and they got back to me asking if I'd like to interview. I spoke with the managing director and explained to him why I'm interested in the role, why I thought I'd be a good fit and then went through some typical interview questions. We got on well, and it turned out that the software they create is similar to the software that I was using and automating every day (SAP). I then went on to a second interview, this time with HR and their lead developer, where I was asked some question on how I would solve several problems in general terms (I didn't have to actually code anything). This went well and I was offered a junior position the following week.

I'm now just over 6 weeks in role, and I feel absolutely in over my head. Every day I hit wall after wall of problems I have no idea how to solve, and feel like I'm constantly fighting our framework of choice. But I love it. I'm finally doing it every day, and someone is actually paying me to do so. I can hardly believe it. I have a long way to go, but the team I'm in is super supportive and I can't wait to get the training wheels of and really get stuck in to something.

All in all, going from an interest in python to working as junior python developer took me a little over seven years. Could this have been done quicker? No doubt. If I had the right focus from the beginning, this probably could have been a year or two. But if my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bicycle. This is the pace it took me, and ultimately I'm really happy.

I know many of you learning have read similar stories before, and I know mine may not be that different from others, but hopefully a few of you might get some helpful takeaways from my story. If I was to summarise the keys steps that landed me employment, it would be these (this is the TLDR):

* Learn the basics of the language, and learn them well. Learn about data types, for loops, while loops, how to iterate through lists, take inputs. Learn about booleans and boolean logic. Learn about functions and classes (and perhaps a bit about object oriented programming). I spent far far FAR too long on this step...

* Learn how to make something. This can be anything. For me this was simple calculators and games to begin with, and moved on to simple programs that could rename files in my media folders.

* Take part in challenges that make use of programming. I adore Advent of Code and the community surrounding it, but there is also Project Euler, Code Wars and I'm sure plenty of others. Take your time with these. Don't cheat (by searching for other solutions before completing your own), but do feel free to use search engines, Reddit and Stack Overflow for ways to achieve sub tasks within your solution. When your done definitely go and compare against other people's solutions, and make note of why someone else's might be better.

* Make use of tutorials and and websites such as Codecademy, but don't *rely* on them. For anything you make during a tutorial, make something similar but different making use of your new skills and using stack overflow to fill gaps in your knowledge for features that weren't covered in the tutorial and that you don't already know.

* Create a GitHub and upload everything you make. Tidy things up and and README files to them.

* Soft skills / related skills: These are all the things you can transfer from other employment such as leadership, teamwork, effective communication etc, but also related tech skills. On my journey I learned how to use Linux, became comfortable with the command line and set up my own VPS on Digital Ocean (and one on Linode). This is NOT as difficult as it might sound if you've never done it before, but it does take some learning.

* Find ways to implement what you learn in to your current job if possible. Automate some processes. Scrape useful data. 

But really, all of the above can be shortened to: Study the language, build things, showcase what you've built.

418,learnpython,n12ruw,Ok-Improvement-6388,A message for all of you.,True,"First off, thank you. I don’t think I would know how to code if I didn’t have you guys. And now I’m here to give what you told me, to the next generation of learners. So here we go.

It’s okay to want to give up. It’s okay to be lost. It’s okay to not know what you want, and what you don’t. It’s all okay.

Because this is what programming is about. Creativity, problem solving, math. But all of these are hard. They don’t come easily. And I know all the seniors here can agree that this never stops. 

It’s like going on a hike. Sometimes your hiking a trail you’ve already hiked. Maybe it’s a bit easier. Although you still are worn out by the end. Or maybe your going on a new hiking trail. And you have no idea where you are going, no idea how to pace yourself, no idea on how to do anything. And that’s where most people give up.

But I can assure you, while it’s still hard, you learn what you are getting yourself into. It’s kind of like learning to walk. It takes time. You start out not knowing how to, and thinking “I’ll never be able to do this.” But then, you take that first step. And you get a little more motivation. So you take bigger and longer steps. And you go farther and faster. And now your grown up, running track in college. It’s still hard, but you know what your doing.

This might be your first language. It might be your second. Maybe even your third. This was my first language. And damn, am I happy I chose it as my first. Because while it’s hard, Python does a ton of the work for you. Take C++ for an example. I don’t call it hard. It’s just a little different. Since you spend do much time trying to do something Python could do way faster(Not in run time, in time spent making it, just to be clear). And Python has so many modules to.

I stand to believe that your first language will always be your favorite. And maybe I just got lucky by choosing Python, but Python definitely is my favorite. 

And if you don’t give up, then one day you will be coding stuff you only dreamt of coding before. I remember the first code I wrote came from a book, a simple number guessing game. I thought it was insanely hard. I thought I was so advanced. And for just starting, I was. You will be to. Even if you think you are bad, you are good, you just don’t have as big of a vocabulary(I guess you could call it that). Now I’m working on AI, games, and more. Stuff I thought only the top programmers in the world could code when I first started.

So just hear me out. If you don’t stop, you won’t lose. That’s a fact. Now I’ve already given you quite a bit of reading time so I’ll not waste any more of your time, and let you go start coding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/n12ruw/a_message_for_all_of_you/,17,2021/04/29-05:00:28
419,learnpython,mrgyx7,MikeDoesEverything,Webscraping with BeautifulSoup - Two different browsers giving different data.,True,"Hello all,

I'm currently scraping the website https://www.lme.com/, however, I've come across an interesting problem.

My current aim and workflow is:

* Parse the HTML

* Have a look at the table on the left and parse out the date.

* If that date is different, scrape some data.

Code is as follows:
    url = ""https://www.lme.com/""
    r = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

    # Isolate table headers
    table_headers = soup.find(""table"").findAll(""th"")

    # Parse table headers down here

Here's the weird part.  First of all, if you open this website, depending on the time of the day, the date will be different depending on which browser you open it up with.  Edge will present the current day whereas Chrome will not update until the allocated time mentioned on the website.  This is fair enough.

Even weirder is even after the website has updated, HTML and all, if you run the code above and print out the output, it will still give the previous date.  So, right now, the date in `table_headers` is 13 April 2021 despite the page clearly showing 14 April 2021.

What I've tried so far:

* Adding `headers` as an argument to `requests` in the form of a full string like this: `
headers = {
    'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.99 Safari/537.36'
}`  as well as adding each of the browsers individually.  No change.  Not sure if this worked correctly or not.

* Altered the parser from `html.parser` to `lxml` and something else (can't remember which it is). Parsers do not make a difference.

* Tried switching to selenium and got exactly the same problem, so it's not JS related.

* Cleared cache.  No difference.

* The above code is currently in a method for a class.  Wrote it out in procedural code, so it's not that either.

So, in short, I'm not sure why BS4 is parsing the HTML differently to how the browser is doing it.  It doesn't look like it has anything to do with the robots settings in the HTML either.  I saw in an old SO post about websites serving data to `requests` with a huge delay resulting in ""old data"".  Could that be the case? If so, very confusing because I can't imagine this site having enough traffic for this level of anti-webscraping measures...

Continuation of the ""From a Beginner to Beginners"" series where I document my learning journey through Python.  Skip to ""Actual Content"" if you want to skip the boring background stuff.

**Background**

I'm a, experienced traditional scientist (Chemistry, specifically synthesis on all scales) who went from zero coding experience to a full time programming position in 6-8 months via self taught material.  I taught myself Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS with Python being my main language.  I am in my 30's.

In total, I spent less than £100 on courses.  Here's a list:

* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming (~£20)

* Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery (~£20)

* Complete Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Bootcamp 2021 (~£20)

* Datacamp: Introduction to SQL (Free)

* Codewars SQL problems (Free)

I spent time building my own projects such as a program which automates mining cryptocurrency when my electricity is cheaper, email spam bots specifically targetting scammers, job application bot for LinkedIn (less than successful), a password manager, and my own website.

After that, I went into freelancing where I exclusively took on webscraping jobs.

**What I do now**

I work full time as a Data Engineer in the financial services sector in the UK.  My job involves turning data collection jobs which were manually carried out every day/month/other time period into automated pipelines using Python and cloud architecture.

**Note**

There were quite a lot of contributing factors into getting a job with the two most prominent being Data Engineeering is an absolutely booming industry right now and, of course, being in the right place at the right time aka lucky.  This is by no means a blueprint on how to get employed, this is my personal experience and yours may differ.

**Overview**

In this post we're going to deal the topics mentioned in the title.  Perhaps you're somebody who is asking yourself ""Am I really good enough?"" and a little nervous to enter the industry or you're just starting out and want to know what it's like taking on a career transition.  Either way, I hope this post has some value to you.

For those interested, here are the previous entries from the series in chronological order:

**Actual Content**

**""But how do I know I'm good enough...?""**

This is all too common as self taught programmers as we often lack the foundation of a lot of computer science principles which CS grads typically have.  The answer to the question is ""You won't know until you try"" which sounds like a cop out, but it's true.  If you are experienced and feeling a little unsure about if you're a good enough applicant, I would invite you to be brave at this moment and throw out a few applications.

It was 4 weeks until I start my new job.  The first week of being offered it, I was on an adrenaline high.  I couldn't sleep and just wanted to get working.  Week two, I was getting a little nervous as I began overthinking with thoughts such as ""What if they got me confused with somebody else? Maybe they overestimated my skill level? I don't really even get OOP! WTF AM I DOING??"".  

By the third week, I was figuratively shitting myself going into this job.  

Although after I began, it really wasn't that bad.  There was a bit of a learning curve to learn serverless architecture although the principles are really the same as doing your own projects - version control via github, comment where necessary, and make sure your code is robust and easy to read i.e. no one letter variables, functions where necessary, and just make it so somebody who can at least read Python code can understand your logic.

**Project Based Learning is King**

If you can make your own projects, you're off to a good start.  If you make your own projects and publish them to github, even better because you'd be then writing code under the assumption other people are going to be able to see it so if you churn out something which works but is completely illegible, it can speak volumes to a potential employer.  I honestly think I'd be struggling in this job if I hadn't made any of my own projects or took any of the very underpaid jobs during freelancing.

From my personal experience in industry, a lot of isn't knowing the documentation in and out.  All of it is being able to justify why you're doing what you're doing and being able to get results.  This is where project based learning comes in - doing course after course will not teach you these abilities and exactly why if you've been learning for a bit and you're asking yourself, ""But what project should I do?"" or ""How do I make projects?"" you should make something.  Anything.  Challenge yourself to make *something* without copying an entire tutorial from start to finish.  It will suck, it will be hard, but you won't become a better programmer without feeling failure, and ultimately, success.

**When to OOP**

This is a fairly short bit about OOP because it's one of Python's biggest strengths although, like many others, I found myself wanting to use OOP for the sake of using OOP rather than really getting the point of it.

Long story short, OOP, like all coding paradigms, is situational.  Sometimes, procedural code is totally fine because that's all you need.  Don't feel bad if you're building something simple for your own use and it doesn't use OOP.

If you need something which is scalable and can be reused, use OOP.

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to MAR2021FREE2 in three days.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)

It is supposed to alert all mod type roles when someone goes against the rules. One of those rules is spam. If you are not an admin, head staff, or owner, your character limit is 65. If you are, your character limit is unlimited. I have all that code, but I need to check if the message author is those roles or if they are not. I also need to DM staff, admins, and head staff because that is how it alerts them. Here is my code:

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_ready(self):
            print('Logged on as', self.user)

432,learnpython,lmi2lg,MikeDoesEverything,From a Beginner to Beginners: From print('Hello World!') to Tutorial Hell to Getting my First Job!,True,"Hello all,

It finally happened! I became employed as a Data Engineer after self studying Python for around 8 months and SQL for around a month or two. For reference, I'm based in the UK.

I lost my job as a traditional scientist around August last year and had been at the mercy of a company doing data science/engineering incorrectly (overfitted models, zero subject matter expertise, dog shit data). So, I took it upon myself to teach myself and prove they were doing it wrong. Little did I know, I ended up discovering something I really enjoyed - making sure everybody is getting the right data.

After around 2 months of applying for jobs, I was contacted out of the blue by a company's HR department which was local who were looking for somebody to join their team as a Data Engineer. This was pretty much nothing to do with my skill level and was 99% luck and being in the right place at the right time as the technical questions weren't as hard as other roles and the role itself is very new in the company. I say nothing to do with my skill level because I really don't think I'm qualified for this job yet.

I had a total of 5 interviews:

Data Engineer (webscraping)

Python Developer/Consultant (I still don't really know what this job is, I took the interview because it was an interview)

Test Automation Engineer

Data Engineer (business intelligence)

Data Engineer (financial services)

All of that aside, I think it's worth going over some stuff which might useful. A lot of the skills in the learn programming subreddits are often a technical discussion and help. Even from a science background there's a lot of similarities in the job search - the assumption good skills alone are enough to land the job. Unfortunately, due to an influx of anybody being able to call themselves a recruiter, job hunting is definitely another skill that all programmers looking to get their job should learn in order to navigate getting strong armed into less than desirable positions for less than desirable conditions.

I was unemployed back in the tail end of the 2008 financial crash as well and, over time, I realised having the experience of job hunting and dealing with job specs, interviews, offers, recruiters was extremely helpful. I completely understand that a lot of people in here may have never been in full time employment before so I thought it'd be useful to highlight what's still relevant:

Culture, Prospects, Location, Money

I would say these are pretty much the things that should drive your decision to get a job.

You want to work with fun, decent people in a place which don't think you're a robot.

You want a job which can either take you places at that company or kick start your career.

It has to be somewhere you don't hate living.

You want to get paid fairly.

Of course, not everything is set in stone and it's very much recommended to decide what you skimp on. I'll echo something I learnt in science - offering to be paid less than the market value might help you now, but really hurts the industry as a whole. Know your worth and stick to it.

For reference, here's the lowdown on a job I turned down vs the job I accepted:

Turned down:

Recruiter constantly asked me the same questions over and over again (is the location okay because you live far away and are you sure you have experience using Python to which I answered yes)

I did 3 interviews for them. First stage was a classic verbal interview where the director literally left on the minute of the time we had allocated for the interview, cutting me off mid sentence. Second stage was a technical task which I received feedback of ""not being great"" (this was because it was below the level of a developer. At no point did I say, or suggest, I was at a developer level. I was also applying for a junior level role) although invited me back for a third interview. Third interview was a series of quick fire technical questions with right/wrong answers. This whole process took 5 weeks.

Spent another 2 weeks telling me they were still looking at other candidates. So we are at 7 weeks for an interview process.

Threw me an offer mid week and wanted me to start Monday.

At the beginning, I was so excited for this job although over time began to despair that this is the only job I might get. Took all of this shite on the chin anyway and began planning my exit strategy. Fortunately, a different job came through:

Interview was carried out as a HR staff member found my CV directly on LinkedIn, emailed, and called me to schedule an interview.

Manager was extremely personable and interested in hearing my motivations, giving me plenty of time to express myself. Also over ran the interview by ten minutes as we were getting along. They called me back on the within two hours to arrange a second stage interview.

Second stage interview was with said manager and the analytics director. Same format of being relaxed and asking a mix of scenario and experience based questions in order to see my approach to solving problems rather than how well I knew the documentation. They also took the time at the end of the interview to get to know me more which was a really positive sign.

I was offered the job about 3 hours after the second stage with an explicit instruction I'll be mostly working from home for the forseeable future and my start date will be at the very earliest in two weeks.

This whole interview process took one week.

The relief and joy I experienced when I got this job was immense and made me realise that being desperate is a dangerous thing.

Know What You're Looking For

Googling is a highly underrated skill and it can be pretty crazy seeing people who are amazing at Googling for solutions to programming problems although completely forget all of that whilst job hunting.

What not to search for:

Software developer jobs london

Software engineer jobs wales

These are honestly the worst things you can search for because they will give you every result for every language and you'll spend a lot of time sifting through shite you don't want to apply for.

How you should search:

Language + developer/engineer/general job title + location + jobs

e.g. javascript front end developer new york city jobs

Sometimes, It's Better to be Lucky Than Be Good

I mentioned earlier getting the position I did was not about skill and more about being in the right place and that's something I want to touch on here.

In the end, as self taught programmers, university graduates, and people looking to change careers, all we want is a chance to prove ourselves. In order to get that chance, you might have to face a few rejections and apply for stuff you might not necessarily be qualified for right now. Although, if you honestly believe it's a job you can do given some time and training and you want to prove that, then every time you see a job application, just send your CV/resume in. It doesn't cost anything and the worst thing that happens is they say no and you aren't ready yet.

Mindset whilst jobhunting is just as important as technical ability because with a weak mindset, you'll never get the opportunity to show what you're really good at.

I hope this was useful to somebody and good luck with everybody also looking to get their first job.  Also a massive thank you to the /r/learnpython community for being helpful in my own journey as well as helping out a lot of people wanting to find answers to their problems.

I am trying to create a hack-pack for CSGO(Only private matches, just thought it would be a cool project). Although after all the hacks launch up, my animation doesn't work.

I thought it would be cool to have some funny ""hacking"" stuff to laugh at, so I came up with this:

    def animation(text, counterLimit):
        counter = 0
        counterLimit = int(counterLimit)
        letters = []
        for letter in text:

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

445,learnpython,n3rylj,ivaylos,Struggling to solve this task from Python Fundamentals - Lists Advanced.,True,"Hello everyone,

2 months ago I started an online course in Python Basics. 

I really enjoy Python and I would love to learn it to the fullest!

In the basics course we learned:

* simple operations (+, -, \*, /, %, //)
* conditional statements (if-elif-else)
* nested conditional statements
* for/while loops
* nested loops

The next course I started is called Python Fundamentals and so far I learned:

* lists basics
* functions (but I haven't practiced them a lot)
* lists advanced

The thing is that while in class we are solving very easy tasks while the tasks we have to do alone are very complicated (at least in my opinion). 

I will give you an example:

When we started learning Lists basics we solved [these tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v41fK-JmlAvOu-Ev-UnaYDiDVfMbTH6NJAKrBlzikVo/edit?usp=sharing). Then we had an online exercise and we solved most of [these tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CayHmZcaFAP5iXmttdUB4WgwdQbFaAitDd_Imvqa9W8/edit?usp=sharing).

And the tasks we had to solve alone are [these](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rGcwZfmcYz0ywjfHbGHFCzcXGFnm4kECMuPOk5Rw-w/edit?usp=sharing).

I have no idea how to solve task 3. Kate's Way Out and task 5. Dots

Could you please help me out?

448,learnpython,neg3hb,ivaylos,MIT offers free online course in Computer Programming using Python,True,"***The course offered by MIT is an introduction to Computer Science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5.***Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT), one of the most premium technical educational institutes in the world, has recently announced a free online course in Computer Programming using Python. The course is available on the edX e-learning platform and the registrations are open until June 2. Here are the course details.  


**About course**  
The course is named "" **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming** **using Python**"". The objective of this course is to provide learners with a brief introduction to many computer programming concepts so as to give them an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, this is not a ""computation appreciation"" course but a challenging and rigorous learning path on which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.  


Python is the most sought-after programming language skill by IT professionals and the demand for skilled Python developers is also very high in the job market. In this course, learners will be taught the nuances of programming using Python 3.5.  


**Course format**  
The class will consist of lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets using Python 3.5. The lecture videos are broken into small pieces usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated ""check-yourself"" questions. Even if you have knowledge of Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in this course. There will also be programming assignments and standalone exams/quizzes, which are not part of the video lectures.  


**What is in it for learners**  


* A Notion of computation
* The Python programming language
* Some simple algorithms
* Testing and debugging
* An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
* Data structures

**Course instructors**  
The course is instructed by 3 MIT professors:  


* John Guttag, Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at MIT
* Eric Grimson, Bernard Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering, Professor of Computer Science at MIT
* Ana Bell, Lecturer, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at MIT

**System requirement**  
You need to have a computer running one of the following operating systems:  
Microsoft Windows, version XP or greater (XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7)  
Apple OSX, version 10.2 or greater  
Linux - most distributions that have been released within the past two years should work  
In addition, you will need the ability to download, install, and run software on your computer.  


**Other important details**  


* This is an instructor-paced course; however, students can watch the lectures at their leisure and do not need to watch the lectures live or at any set time.
* The course starts on June 2 and will end on August 5. So, you are required to enrol before June 2.
* The course is free.

**How to enrol**  
To enrol in this program, you can visit the [MITx course page on edX here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7).

I'm continuing making a program which needs to cycle through a bunch of images.  At the moment, I have a lot of

functions and I would love to turn this into a functions to save a lot of typing.  From my understanding of functions, I have tried this:

    def locate(image):
        pyautogui.locateOnScreen(image)

This returns none due to it needing a confidence value.  I have confirmed this by comparing to:

    example = pyautogui.locateOnScreen('image.jpg', confidence=0.9)

Which returns true.  I'm now trying to bake the confidence value into the function and am a little confused on where it needs to go.  Here's what I've tried:

     def locate(image, confidence=0.9):

All of which return false whereas the example variable always works.

455,learnpython,iw2hd9,veeeerain,Quant Finance in Python?,True,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying statistics and double minoring in economics and computer science. I’ve been doing quite a bit of data science work with structured datasets, and have had some basic machine learning experience and deep learning experience with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow respectively. However, I’ve read online that ML and AI is also heavily involved within finance, specifically “Quant Finance”. It seemed interesting, and considering I’m pursuing an Econ minor doing some projects and getting experience with time series data is something I want to do to hopefully one day end up in this field. However for anyone who does this stuff could I get a breakdown of what exsctly goes into quant finance projects? I know python is used but what exactly do you do? Recommendation engines?

**I'm sharing this here on this subreddit because I think learning and being able to use Git and GitHub can be a big motivation boost to anyone who's learning any programming language; Besides, it's an essential knowledge that a programmer should learn eventually. I've elaborated more on this down below. I hope the moderators find this post relevant.**

I tried to make everything in this Notion page as beginner-friendly and organized as possible. I hope it'll be easy to follow for anyone who's trying to learn Git and GitHub.

In my opinion, learning to code feels fun and more meaningful when one maintains a repository where they upload projects/programs/scripts as they learn newer things and undertake new projects to practice what they've learned. The idea itself of maintaining and completing projects on GitHub makes one feel motivated to keep on learning. It gives one a sense of working towards an objective or goal. And this is why I started to learn Git and GitHub in the middle of when I just started learning Python.

I had to struggle quite a bit in learning Git and GitHub, and I also see many people, especially people who just started to learn code and any programming syntax, who struggle a lot in grasping the different features, commands, and concepts of Git and GitHub.
I think learning about Git and GitHub can be a little difficult for absolute beginners primarily because of how scattered the relevant learning materials are on the internet, and almost everything is explained or written using jargon and concepts that normally a person with minimum programming knowledge would understand.


And so, this Notion page is just an attempt of mine to consolidate everything into one place.

It has been about three weeks since I started learning Python, and I'm also following this book for learning Python as a complete beginner.

* *Assigned a list value containing 9 lists as items to* ***grid****.*

&amp;#x200B;

**The 2 for-loops:**

    for j in range(len(grid[0])):

* len(grid\[0\]) = len(first list of the overall list value) = 6
* This for-loop will run 6 times

&amp;#8203;

    for i in range(len(grid)):

* len(grid) = 9 ; Because there are 9 lists in it as items.
* This for-loop will run 9 times

&amp;#x200B;

**for-loop in a for-loop (i's for-loop in j's for-loop):**

    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            print(grid[i][j], end='')
    print()

* **i's for-loop** will initialize *6 times* as it's in **j's for-loop** and run *9 times* for each time it's initialized.

&amp;#x200B;

***grid\[ i \]\[ j \] &amp; end='' :***

    print(grid[i][j], end='')

* `end=''` will prevent any new line character from being added at the end of the string. By default, a new line character is appended to the string in the print function if no optional parameter is specified. So, all the characters passed to this specific `print function` will be printed in a single line every time it is run.

As `print(grid[i][j], end='')` is in i's for-loop, which is again in j's for-loop, the following happens:

*  *grid\[i\]\[j\]:* When 'i' loop's first run is in 'j' loop's first run, 'j' is set to 0, and 'i' is set to grid's first item (first list). 

*That means the first item of the first list of the grid will be printed.* 

* This progression will continue till the last run of **i's for-loop**, *with 'j' being set from 0 to 5 for each run of j's for-loop*.  

&amp;#x200B;

**But, keep in mind that the block of code of j's for-loop doesn't end with** `print(grid[i][j], end='')`**. The block of code of j's for-loop ends with** `print()` **at the very end.**

&amp;#x200B;

* So, `print()` is run after `print(grid[i][j], end='')`, and a new line is started every time this print() is run.
* **Therefore, each run of j's for-loop ends with a new line.**

As a result, the output looks like this:

    ..OO.OO..
    .OOOOOOO.
    .OOOOOOO.
    ..OOOOO..
    ...OOO...
    ....O....

# For context/reference, here's what is asked in the Practice Project:

 Say you have a list of lists where each value in the inner lists is a one-character string, like this: 

    grid = [['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
            ['.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.', '.'],
            ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],
            ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.'],
            ['.', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
            ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.'],
            ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],
            ['.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.', '.'],
            ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']]

You can think of grid\[x\]\[y\] as being the character at the x- and y-coordinates of a “picture” drawn with text characters. The (0, 0) origin will be in the upper-left corner, the x-coordinates increase going right, and w the y-coordinates increase going down. Copy the previous grid value, and write code that uses it to print the image. 

    ..OO.OO..
    .OOOOOOO.
    .OOOOOOO.
    ..OOOOO..
    ...OOO...
    ....O....

Hint: You will need to use a loop in a loop in order to print grid\[0\]\[0\], then grid\[1\]\[0\], then grid\[2\]\[0\], and so on, up to grid\[8\]\[0\]. This will finish the first row, so then print a newline. Then your program should print grid\[0\]\[1\], then grid\[1\]\[1\], then grid\[2\]\[1\], and so on. The last thing your program will print is grid\[8\]\[5\]. 

Also, remember to pass the end keyword argument to print() if you don’t want a newline printed automatically after each print() call.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jm0af3/character_picture_grid_practice_project2_solution/,0,2020/11/01-02:42:07
464,learnpython,jrpaxj,MikeDoesEverything,Converting a bunch of hyperlinks into a list - how?,True,"Hello, 

I'm currently in a project where I've extracted a bunch of hyperlinks from an excel spreadsheet and I want to add all of these links into a list so I can loop over them later.  Here's my code from a Jupyter Notebook so far:
    
    # Import data
    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx')
    ws = wb['Sheet1']
    
    # Select columns
    hyperlinks = ws[""B""]
    
    # Extract hyperlinks starting from row 2, column 2
    for links in hyperlinks:
        for i in range(len(hyperlinks)):
            link = (ws.cell(row=i+2, column=2).hyperlink.display)
            print(link)

So, this does work fine and I get a bunch of hyperlinks although, as I understand it, I'll want to loop over these late with BeautifulSoup so I can scrape each link for the same information, so I'll need to convert these into a list.  At the moment, this is just a bunch of strings.

Problems:

* How do I convert these into a list? I've tried using `append` like this:
    
        for links in hyperlinks:
            for i in range(len(hyperlinks)):
                link = (ws.cell(row=i+2, column=2).hyperlink.display)
                link_list=[]
                link_list.append(link)
                print(link_list)

Although this converts everything into a big block of invidual items as a list item.  I'm not sure where I'm going wrong here.

* In the top bit, I use `(ws.cell(row=i+2, column=2).hyperlink.display` which is, intuitively, wrong as the count starts at 0 and I want to start in cell 2, so from what I understand, i+1 should be my starting position although this gives me an error as there's no hyperlink to be found.  Could somebody explain this to me please?

* On top of that, every time I run this code, whilst it gives me the correct output (somewhat), I always get an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'display'`.  This sounds like it is going outside of the range and reading an empty cell, not producing a value and throwing an error and I suspect it's something to do with my dodgy bit of code in my last point.

465,learnpython,jrwi6d,MikeDoesEverything,Just completed my first job on Upwork!,True,"Holy shit, that was a wild ride.

So, I've just completed my first job on upwork and, jesus god, was it harder than I thought.  The actual job wasn't very difficult although I totally suck at programming so it took way longer than it should have.  I learn an absolute ton from it and wanted to share it with all you guys as a way of paying back for all the good advice I've been given.

** The job **

The job was to scrape financial data from a bunch of websites which the client had already compiled.  The data was structured as an excel spreadsheet with hyperlinks embedded in text.

** Initial thought process **

* Cycle through the spreadsheet, parse all hyperlinks into a list for later.

* As all the data is from the same website, I'm going to scrape one page and get all the relevant data, then loop over it for the rest.

* I'm going to add these values as I go along into excel through Python.

* This will be fairly easy.

** What actually happened **

* I spent about 30 minutes trying this in vscode, setting up a virtual environment and after running my program a few times, I realise I couldn't see shit.  At this point, I got annoyed and transitioned into a Jupyter Notebook.  This made seeing what I was doing a lot easier and I'd recommend any data-centric projects to be done in Juypter.

* I spent about an hour having trouble with list comprehension and loops.  Turns out if you run a loop within a loop, you're going to get it running twice and I wanted to run two loops parallel to each other.  I solved this by using `for x,y in zip(list1, list2):`

* I've always said I hated parsing text because everything seems so complex.  Today, I overcame my fear using `' '.join`, `split()`, and `strip()`.  This probably isn't much to a lot of people, although it all came together for me today and it's something I'm really happy with.

* When it came to webscraping, I got really lazy and paid the price for it.  I used list slicing on elements incorrectly and ended up having it so it worked for my sample size (first two websites in list), although when it got to the latter ones, it started to do funky stuff so I had to start all over again.

* Before that, I deleted all my code to start again because I thought I was parsing data incorrectly.  Turns out it was just the unicode symbols for Euro signs :( Check it's actually wrong before rage-quitting.

* Sometimes, plans do go the way you want.  I was originally hoping to fire off a load of numbers from juypter into excel in this beautiful streamlined vision.  After spending so much time parsing text from beautifulsoup, I decided to give up on that dream for today and, instead, think outside the box.  I ended up printing data to a text file, importing it via excel, cleaning it in excel, and then copy and pasting it.  I think it's also only fair for me to mention this took about 40 minutes - I spent so long printing formatted output in Jupyter and really enjoying it that I forgot about the task.  I spent a while getting the data to save horizontally with the right delimiter so I could copy and paste it into the clients spreadsheet.

* There's a lot of stop-start, especially as a non-professional, self taught person which feels fairly natural.  I think if you know what you want to do, you can Google through it with some persistence but if you can't say how you'd approach the problem it's infinitely harder (like when I wanted to make my streamline dream) so you might have to just give up on a fancy idea and stick to what you know sometimes.

                submit_button = (""//button[@data-control-name='submit_unify']"")

                        except NoSuchElementException:
                            continue

So, where I'm having trouble with specifically is:

            buttons = [next_button, review_button, follow_button, submit_button]
            while True:
                for b in buttons:
                    time.sleep(1)
                    button = driver.find_element_by_xpath(b) 
                    try: 
                        if button:
                            time.sleep(1)
                            button.click()
                            print(f'{button} clicked')
                    except NoSuchElementException:
                        continue

What I want to achieve on paper is:

* Make a list of elements appear on every application

* Loop through them

* If element, click on element.  If not element, continue cycling through list

* (Not written yet) Break out of loop once the ""submit"" condition is met.

However, selenium has an annoying habit where if it can't find the element, it throws up the error for `NoSuchElementException`.  I've tried to circumvent this by continuing the loop if this error occurs, although it would appear I don't really understand how `continue` works and, also, I read on Stack that you shouldn't really use try except blocks to control flow.  I always understood `continue` goes back to the start of the loop.

My main questions are:

* Is there a way I can get selenium to continuously loop over my list of elements without it exiting due to the `NoSuchElementException`error?

* Am I using `continue` incorrectly?

469,learnpython,jt76gz,MikeDoesEverything,Pandas question - How do I loop through a column and print my answer?,True,"Hello,

I recently made a post about an Upwork job that I posted about where I scraped financial data and I would very much like to improve my code.

People mentioned Pandas in the last post and I stupidly thought, 'Yes, I know about Pandas' without really understanding what they meant.  I've now got this thought process:

* Take parsed data and add to a dataframe

* Clean accordingly

So I've created a function which looks like this:

    def table_scraper(markets, hyperlinks):
    """"""
    Function used to loop over markets and hyperlinks to markets and extract the desired tables.
    """"""
    for m, h in zip(markets, hyperlinks):

        print(f'Getting data for {m}...')

        url = get(h)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(url.text, 'lxml')

        
        # Balance
        ba = soup.find(""li"", class_=""list-group-item"")
        bal = ba.text.strip().split()
        balance = bal[1]

What I'd very much like to do is print balance to a spreadsheet which already has columns in it.  So far I've tried

    df['Balance'] = balance

This was just added onto the end.

    for row in df.iterrows():
        ba = soup.find(""li"", class_=""list-group-item"")
        bal = ba.text.strip().split()
        balance = bal[1]
        df['Balance'] = row

With `iterrows`, it printed the first value all the way down, although I know it did the right thing - went over every row like I wanted it to.

472,learnpython,jwgatc,MikeDoesEverything,"Going from print('Hello World)' to tutorial hell to building my own ""data pipeline"" - From a beginner to beginners",True,"Hello all,

I recently wrote a post about [getting my first paid job on Upwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jrwi6d/just_completed_my_first_job_on_upwork/).  I got rehired by the same person to do even more work with the conversation going like this:

Client: This work is great.  Now, can we do the same for everything please?

Me: As far as I'm aware, all of the fields are filled.  Could you give me some more detail?

Client: *sends me a search page* You see all this info here? All 39 pages? Could we do exactly the same for all of these please? (client said it much nicer than this)

To avoid any confusion, I got asked to scrape a whole website of financial data and condense it into a spreadsheet.  This was a pain in the tits for the following reasons:

* The pages in the first post were static.  This is a dynamically loaded website.

* It's a lot more data - it ended up being over 18,000 data points.

* It needed a lot more code.

Long story short, I managed this and got it in on time and got paid! I enjoyed it so much I ended up making it a ""data pipeline"" (if you can even call it that) where it scrapes the data, passes it to a function which saves it to a CSV, and then passes the CSV to Pandas to have it cleaned and formatted.  All in one Jupyter Notebook cell!

5 months ago, I didn't know a single thing about code and now I can do this.  It's amazing and I'd love to be able to give some people a realistic opinion, as a beginner, to other people starting out. 

**Tutorials are a bit misleading**

As with all people learning, I'm sure you've probably watched tons of videos.  Whilst they're useful, it can be very disheartening watching somebody cane out code in 10 minutes which takes you 3 hours.

[Here's a video which made me feel better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIOhRD9J9oU&amp;)

I saw this as I was transitioning out tutorial hell and it was very sobering how a lot of what he said happened.  I spent a lot more time searching for solutions, and running the same blocks of code with minor adjustments over and over again until it did what I want than I did watching my code work.  Also, actual time spend coding was a lot less than checking for ridiculously small things like unmatched brackets.

My code was literally trash and a mess which didn't make any sense whilst I was doing the job.  Huge chunks of code which worked and commented out as I was trying to fix things, code which didn't work and I forgot to delete, random comments I made whilst I was angry.  My code *worked* though and it's something the client never sees.  After I finished, I took the code and made it WAY cleaner just in case anybody would want to see it.

Judging from what more experienced people have said, this is the normal cycle of programming and thinking you're going to one-shot code is the mindset to failure.  Programming is about problem solving and problem solving involves running into a lot of problems and when I say problem solving, I mean a lot less ""If Jack has 3 apples and Jill has X-n^2 apples, come up with an algorithm which sorts out a list of even numbers and every odd number produces the word 'lmao'"".  I would say problem solving can be summarised with 'figuring out why your code isn't doing what you want it to do'. 

**Googling stuff and copying code is normal**

I used to feel like such a joke googling stuff for solutions and being unable to rattle stuff of the top of my head.  Same with copying code other people have done and subbing my own variables in there.

After about 2 months of doing this, this is pretty much what programming is like.  So don't feel bad if you do - this is normal.  Nobody feels guilty when they copy a recipe off youtube to impress somebody and nobody should feel bad for taking publicly available code and adapting it for their own purposes (within reason).

**Getting out of ""tutorial hell""**

I spent about 4 months in this stage.  I've done three courses overall and felt the same all the way through, 'me following along means I'm learning!'.  Unfortunately, this isn't true.  I ended up wondering why people were doing stuff the way they were doing it rather than understanding what was going on.

One of the most asked questions on here is 'I'm a beginner.  What should I build?' and usually people say the same projects which are projects 100 other people have documented and fine tuned. The obsession with using some sort of phrase involving the word 'build' or 'building' gets bandied a lot around here and I do think the concept is poorly explained although is correct.  I think the more apt advice for getting out of tutorial hell is:

""Come up with your own ideas and then build them""

Building what you're interested in and is useful to you is very different than churning out programs hundreds of other people have done and is the beauty of being self taught - getting over that hump and generating your own ideas is a steep, very rewarding learning curve.  Ultimately, from what I've learn from tutorials, is that zero courses teach you how to be creative and if you can't be creative, programming is really really hard.

My example projects before this huge one above was a password manager and a program to automate my computer to begin mine crypto when my electricity is cheap.  I also made loads of other stupid shit like a bot which spams annoying messages in chat channels with a sleep timer to avoid getting timed out, spamming email boxes of people who have sent me junk mail with scary pictures.  I came to the conclusion that all of the stuff I *like* to build is incredibly troll and that's totally cool as long as I don't use my powers for evil on a grand scale.

Which brings me to my next point...

**Have some fun**

Learning Python and programming always felt like a race to me.  ""How much time will it take for me to become a paid, full time programmer?"" was always on my mind and, to be honest, it ruined a lot of the learning for me.  I've had a lot of down days because it felt like I was ""slow"" compared to these people on youtube who became Software Engineers for the FAANG groups in 6 month, or these 15 year old kids winning Google coding competitions. I felt like I was ""missing out"" on earning a lot of money because of a lack of ability, rather than realising the only person that sets the goals posts is me.  Comparison is the thief of joy, after all.

Putting yourself under a lot of pressure to get somewhere is definitely a path to burning out.  My missus told me the other week that I ""looked tired"" and when I looked up at the clock, I had been sat at my computer for 6 hours without a break.  Whilst I don't disparage working hard, I do disparage disconnecting from your health.

**Build your Github as soon as you can**

This is something I learnt far too late.  EDIT: Elaborated on below:

I say build a Github because a lot of people's goals are to become a software engineer or developer and a lot of people are also self taught although there's no really ""good"" way of showcasing your projects and what you've done on your resume/cv. Github is what developers use as part of their pipelines and a lot of jobs expect you to be able to use, so if you have a Github showcasing your work it shows your portfolio and suggests you at least know what Github is.

If you start late, like I did, you'll have a bunch of concentrated commits into your repository which doesn't look very professional and isn't visually very encouraging. A steady stream of projects over time shows that you've put a bunch of effort into either submitting projects or contributing towards other projects and helps boost the strength of your application.

**Your career aspirations can change, and that's okay too**

I have a background in chemistry and was enamoured with the idea of becoming a data scientist.  What I learnt from doing python is two things -

* I really like collecting data and automating things.

* I really hate analysing data.

And that's alright with me.  I know what jobs I should be looking for now!

Of course, this is all just my opinion based on personal experience.  I always recommend going out there and getting your own.  I hope this was helpful to some beginners!",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jwgatc/going_from_printhello_world_to_tutorial_hell_to/,174,2020/11/18-06:03:19

Frequently Asked Questions:

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

“Learn other programming languages”

For that, I already have. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Python, all I have made is text based programs. But programming is so big, that you need a niche(Software Dev, Web Dev, etc.) but I don’t know what. 

“Learn more languages”

I need something to motivate me though. 

“If you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, why don’t you do Web Dev?”

Well, obviously I tried that since how else do you learn HTML without building a website. But I don’t really like it. The whole art of making everything perfect and creating a box just to make a button is a pain to me. Plus, I feel really comfortable with Python. So I want to use Python mostly. 

“You mentioned Software Dev, why not that?”

Well I am definitely interested in that. At least kind of interested. I don’t know if it’s similar to Web Dev. But at least I can use Python for a good amount of it. But it also seems a little more complex, with JSON and stuff.

I know I will make this a function, and call it at the start of the while loop. Just don't know how I would write that function. At first, I thought I would have to write every single possibility, but this is computer science with Python. There's always an easier way to do things. So I know there is a way to do this, I just need a little help finding it.

517,learnpython,gbp0a1,AlSweigart,"""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" Udemy course free to sign up until May 7th.",True,"https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy (This link will automatically redirect you to the latest discount code.)

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: MAY2020FREE (on Monday the code changes to MAY2020FREE2)

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=MAY2020FREE

This promo code works until May 7th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code MAY2020 or JUN2020 (or whatever month/year it is) or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $14 to $16. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, which means I don't get the credit for referral signups. Blerg.)

Frequently Asked Questions:

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/gbp0a1/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_udemy/,181,2020/05/01-12:49:35

        print(numbers_as_string())
        guess = int(input(""Guess the number: ""))
        check_guess(guess, randint)
   
The idea of this is that it will print out 1 to 20 from a generate list, and every time you guess a number it replaces the no longer valid numbers with X. (i.e, if the Random Int is 8 and you guess 10, it will replace 10 - 20 with X's)

However, on testing I find that I can guess one number and it works just fine. However, when I guess a second number it fails and I get the error:

1013,programmerhumor,ia5gx8,yuva-krishna-memes,Summary of Bad Programming Humor,True,"To Sum up the bad programming humor..

A small fictional writeup..( Please excuse if you don't like it as it's just a casual attempt) 

Here we go..

""One of reqruiter had posted that they need someone who has 50 experience in HTML programming. So I started my career in  ""Programming"" with learning HTML, along with shameless php and soon started to realize to get expertise in quirky javascript as well.

Initially when learning programming, I thought the array starts at 1 and had semicolon missing on every line I code..but later evolved a lot.. I now only worry about 500 compilation errors and ignore those 1000 warnings..

One of my friend suggested about Java and App development. So I started learning it and everyone wanted me to develop an App with their useless ideas. And moreover using the Android Studio and Chrome together made my laptop an mini oven, so I started using an simple dark mode IDE as  its cool to use a dark background.. 

I started to use linux OS and terminal window in front of everyone so it makes me look like an hacker... I even have opened vim in one of the terminal but yet to close it after 4 years as I donno how to save it or exit out of it. I love vim..

I don't have a life or I make great money but keeps fighting with testing team for hiding defects. To tell about my past,  I have also coded in Bloated Java and tricky C++ but they are not as good as Python, where I can code an whole AI and do ML in 5 days. Whatever nothing comes close to HTML programming.. it's fun.

I don't know a shit about Functional programming..and I hate OOPS as it's bad to objectify anything. 

I don't have a girlfriend as every thing in this world I relate to Programming. I am typing this while my Manager and Client are doing casual covid smalltalk,  whereas me banging heads on an Priority bug for past 45 days... Stackoverflow users have already called me stupid enough and duplicated all my questions. ""
